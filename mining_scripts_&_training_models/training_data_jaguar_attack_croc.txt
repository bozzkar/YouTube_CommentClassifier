It's just amazing :DÔªø
Most of videos with titles like this end up being dissapointly boring. I know it's not a crocodile, rather a caiman, but still, thanks for delivering.Ôªø
Nice nida, this renek had the fear of his life^^Ôªø
A croc is animal with long nasty teethIt moans and bites at anything it seesits back is tough and its brain is smallbut it will scare you straight up the walland, by the way, if you only eat your meatyou may grow up to be that kind of beastA jag is a cat with specks on its backIt's cute and sweet but it doesn't fear attackto feed its kids is its only thoughtthough its fast it may still get caughtbut then if meeting it is what you wantyou may end up in the sandAnd all the crocos aren't in the zooon youtube you meet quite a fewso you see it's all up to youyou could be faster than those areyou could be swinging op a starÔªø

+Martina Kausch es gibt noch ein √§hnliches Video auf YouTube.Ôªø
This is just a caiman, even not dangerous for men. i have seen a group of otters killing this animal. The issue would be different with a seawater crocodile or nile crocodile.Ôªø

I'll have a nice pair of leather boots and a jaguar carpet pleaseÔªø
When I see this I'm like: OMG animal dying!Just like when I see any other animal eating each other... but then I realize... this is the natural circle of life! :) The one animal killing we should be really worry about is the killing done from humans to animals, because is excessive and selfish! Humans kill animals for fashion!!! (Leather, Fur, etc.) I believe there is enough plastic and cotton in this world to dress us and not be killing animals just to "look good". Let's protect our nature and species :)Ôªø
And that's........ The jaguar..... Lol. Good videoÔªø

The title is misleading, these are Caiman like he says in the video and not a crocodile. I was expecting a 16 foot croc not a tiny caimanÔªø
NIDALEE LEAVE THIS RENEKTON PLZ Kappa :DÔªø
Wow thats amazing! Ôªø
"thats pretty laserbeam focus if you ask me""this guy is good""1, 2, BOOM!"- if you only listen to the audio you could think youre listening to a CoD-Commentary and a clan with the name "Jaguar" is battling " Team Kaiman".Ôªø

yeah nida, fuck that rene xDÔªø
Nidalee VS RenektonÔªø
This is why I'm not vegetarian. And why I don't get all pissy when people hunt large cats.Ôªø
Why is the video titled with the word Crocodile, when the narrator clearly says that it is a Caiman?  Although Caiman are in the Crocodylian family, they are the smallest, falling below alligators.  Just a little misleading.Ôªø
Lacoste is dead :/Ôªø
wow, thats impressive. i didnt think crocs had a lot of animals above them in the food chains, not even the big cats. but this was game over within seconds, im surprised.Ôªø
thats pretty damn bad ass.Ôªø
Unbelievable! Ôªø
xd RENEKTOR REPORT plz:pÔªø
when the jaguar attacks, i like to see the other crocodile in the back swimming to somewhere safe.Ôªø
Great narration...and GREAT CATCH!Ôªø
Not a Crocodile or Gator, that is a Cayman which is 100 lbs max. Jaguars can't kill Crocs. Ôªø
This is ... impressive.Ôªø
Those jaguars are freakin amazing cats!Ôªø

clever JAGUAR action was awesome.....Ôªø
Report Renekton no wards in river ggwpÔªø
That's a Caiman not your regular crocodile because they are small. I would wanna see an Australian salt water crocodile or a Nile crocodile destroy this jagÔªø

That awkward moment when the food chain gets confused.Ôªø
Some of these comments.. Guys if you do not know about Nature please stop posting non sense. Gustave Crocodile as you say it is not a species of crocs he's just a big Nile that they've named Gustave he's also presumed to have killed over 100 people. Jaguars, predators on the whole do not care what the meat tastes like.. They are animals of opportunity and will take advantage of that. Big cats have far lesser taste buds than humans, hence why they will and can scavenge. As far as the Caimans armour. Not an issue for Panther Once. He posseses the strongest jaws in the feline family. Ôªø

Wow amazing footage.. I don't belive a Jaguar hunting a Caiman has ever been caught on film nonetheless a Jaguar swimming across a body of water and launching an amphibious attack.Ironic the Jaguar used the Caimans usual technique of hunting for the kill. Ôªø
y el otro cocodrilo donde se fue, en el min 1:06 aparecen dosÔªø
Like a bossÔªø
Lol you can see the other caiman in the background when the jaguar gets the kill. He's like, "fuck this I'm out of here", and goes in the water.Ôªø
Thats pretty cool.Ôªø
whoa, that jaguar is like crazy good... lolÔªø
 I never imagined this daring act of the Jaguar.wow!Ôªø
Awesome Ôªø

More impressive is a Tiger taking on a proper Croc, the Mugger Crocodile from India ect.Ôªø
No Crocodiles. Caimen are small Alligators of South America. There are much rarer Crocs in SAmerica, they are larger than Caimen, but much Rarer.Ôªø
FUCKING AWESOME.  SUCH RAW FUCKING POWER.    Ôªø
Wow I knew tigers could do that, but didn,t know jaguars could kill it and pick it up like nothign with its jaws hahaÔªø

Yeah Jaguars are great swimmers.Ôªø
Wow! I didn't think any animal would want to eat a scaly reptile. I guess crocodile meat tastes better than I imagined.Ôªø
Wow, just wow.  I never knew jaguars ate crocks.  Amazing.  He totally knew the kill spot as well to take him out without any struggling. Ôªø
Wow bad ass jaguarÔªø

Wow!Ôªø
WOW. I always liked jaguars, even as a little kid looking over big cats and not-so-big cats in books and shows about animals. I noticed they had a peculiar build; muscular like all cats, but and emphasis on sheer strength of grappling something, with that thick rounded head and heavy-looking bones. This video confirms me as a fan. Ôªø

When a jaguar pounces, sometimes one bite is all it takes to get a meal. National Geographic has exclusive video of a jaguar taking down a caiman in Brazil's Pantanal wetlands, photos of which went viral earlier this month. Luke Dollar, a conservation scientist who helps manage National Geographic's Big Cats Initiative, explains the hunt and explosive moment of predation.Read the article from National Geographic News:http://news.nationalgeographic.com/ne...VIDEOGRAPHERS: Kedar Hippalgaonkar and Parul JainNARRATOR: Luke DollarEDITOR: Will HalicksSPECIAL THANKS: Jason KurtisRESEARCH: Joe LemerisÔªø

NatGeo should know better that we  do not have crocodiles in Brazil, . The species shown in the video probably is Caiman latirostris or Caiman crocodilus (despite this name, not a croc). The largest (and deadliest man eaters) species found in Brazil is Melanosuchus niger.Ôªø

Nobody is saying that Africans in Africa will ever be a minority Nor is anybody saying that Asians in Asia will ever be a minority. So why are they saying Whites will be a minority in Britain in 2036? And Sweden in 2024? That‚Äôs because there‚Äôs MASSIVE non-White immigration in EVERY White country and ONLY White countries. Because there‚Äôs a program of White geNOcide. They say it‚Äôs ‚Äúanti-racist‚Äù but it‚Äôs simply anti-White. Anti-Racist is a codeword for anti-White.Ôªø

Surprised she didn't throw a spear to start.
Mature crocodiles do not have any predators other then humans. This is a caiman, a sub species of crocodile. But most caimans only reach 6 ft like this one was if that. How ever a nile croc can reach 17 to almost 20 ft and weigh over 1000 pounds. A salt water croc can reach over 20 ft and weigh up to 3000 pounds. So it would have been a different outcome had it been a nile or saltwater croc.
Jag for the win!

u must be joking right, no one can be that stupid, ok lol good joke funny ! 
it is ! a freaking spider or a jellyfish can literally kill you ! among other things
The jaguar has the strongest bite force (2000 psi) of any cat. Stronger compared to tiger (1000 psi), and to lion (600 psi) w/c is the weakest bite force of all the predator cats. Jaguar is the winner! love the tiger too.

Not really sure if the tiger made it safely back to the other side on the way back, as you see afew others Crocodile around .

I wouldn't think a jaguar could penetrate the hard reptilian skin of a crocodile. Apparently they are vulnerable to attack behind the neck. However, a good swipe of those crocodile jaws and teeth could break the neck of that jaguar or at least the crocodile could drown the jaguar by pulling it into the water.
soy gay
Depends on stalking , that crocodile could do the same thing hungry in a surprize attack wouldnt think twice, although it be wise to think first twice before skating upon thin ice.
OK, the narration was excellent from the point of view of my blind friends. This was of excellent value. The only thing was they had to infer from the title what a caiman was.

I don't see how the jaguar could have killed the caiman grabbing it where he did with the tought thick skin ,especially carring it through the water where the caimen is far more efficient than the jaguar ,they should have shown the rest of it. 
Oh that's Caiman okay, but helpless? Geeze... with those big teeth and big body, "helpless" is quite exaggerated.
Still...this is pretty impressive...walked off with that Caiman like a boss.
oh my humane killer
Dunno, a lion killing a dwarf crocodile shouldn't be surprising. My issue with their marketing has more to do with the neglect of tigers: "They are certainly the most aquatic of all the big cats".

Nossa! Que moral do tigre heim!
Stand up
Caimans are NOT "crocodiles". They are wimpified versions of alligators (narrow snouts). "Crocodiles" as we know them comprise the largest and most powerful of the Order Crocodylia (Family Crocodylidae). National Geographic should know better than to label a video disingenuously at the "Order" level of classification. A large cat killing a crocodile would be something! Killing a wimpy, relatively helpless caiman is disappointing. Shame on NG for false marketing!
wow!!!!
I see the coco pops croc got what was finally coming to him.
that's in the red buff 
Wow!!!!Ôªø

How are Italians being forced to end their race/culture?
Ideolt uploaded !
Why is it that EVERY white country is forced to be multicultural/multiracial? Why is it that EVERY white country is told to end its own race/culture? No one asks that of -ANY- non-White country. Immigration/assimilation is FORCED upon ONLY White countries Anti-whites call themselves ‚Äúanti-racists‚Äù but their actions lead to the elimination of only one race, the White race. The purpose of ‚Äúanti-racism‚Äù is to genocide white children. Anti-racist is a code for anti-White /watch?v=ZC2uE6Y5sF0

THAT LITTLE IGUANA-LOOKIN' THING JUST GOT ATE! DAMN NATURE, YOU SCARY. 
it's a joke. nidalee is the jaguar, "nerf" means "make her weaker because its too powerful", and the bit about AFK is the other caiman who did nothing. I think.

fucking hell jaguar is on√ßa pintada in english. its like going around saying "dont say hello say ola" its the same thing so there is no problem.
well u cant really say it is a crocodile because its a alligator. you can say it is a corcadilian tho 
well i actually like cats and what he is saying is kinda true 
they can
i think he meant that caiman are in the order of crocadylia (not sure if that is spelt right) which they are so he is not wrong. 
u say that like a anaconda would even stand the slightest chance against a nile croc. i can bet that not even a full grown tiger or lion would be able to kill a full grown nile crock and a jaguar wouldn't even attempt to if it valued its life 
hi im a jaguar let me hug your throat with my jaw 
lol its not even the king on land. more like the youngest prince of the cat world 
I hope you're trolling. in these times where spell check is available I have never seen a comment butcher the English language quite like this. I am all for using shorter versions of words like 2 for to but this is too far.

Like if the fine brothers spoilers sent you here. XD
Sounds like Danny McBride
ninja!!!!! 
Lol
Cats rule
Too bad the Jaguars are going to get killed by the Broncos. 
You're right that Caiman are smaller and it should be called "Jaguar attacks Caimain" not "...Crocodiles". But Caiman can get up to 13 feet long and that was still pretty crazy. Most people would assume a Jaguar would pick something with a less strong jaw to attack back with or less durable skin. Look at 1:47-1:53 and tell me that isn't intense how the Jaguar just picks that big thing up with his teeth and walks away with it.
5352 people said the cameraman should have saved the camen...
123 baam!!
That be one mother'ucking badass!
at 1:43 another Crocodile in the left going to help the victim 
We're heeeeeeere.
Nidalee is that you? 
I feel like a Jaguar attacking an ACTUAL Crocodile would be a lot more intense... Caiman are small compared to Crocs and Gators
Jaguar Win !
It's not a croc; it's a caiman.

Chuck Noris ask his pet the jaguar to get him a caiman skin purse...guess what...the jaguar brings back a caiman instead...
Nerf jaguar plz
I think people dislike because they think the hawk video is fake. I could be wrong but that was my thinking...
I guess the jaguar was on a hurry because he grab it to go XD
Danm natu... DANMMMIIIITTT !!!!

Damn nature, you scary!
Brace yourselves, FineBros fans are coming...
Great video and narration!
The honey badger guy needs to come back :,)
cool!

You Scary!
Who needs a hitman when you can set a jaguar on someone?
Damn Nature....
That is one BAMF
Ah, someone just sad they didn't get 41 likes!!!
My cat does this to me everyday. I believe NOW, I should be concerned. 
Hmm. Never seen a Jaguar eat a Croc before, pretty awesome
This is freaking amazing, where can I see more footage of this type of stuff, I don`t have the National Geograpgic Channel! :(
Smoking some weed and for some reason i stumbled across this video and its sooo coooll. Gota live the utube.
Nature, you scary. 
Wtf
I like the way this guy is critiquing the jaguars form like it's a boxing match or something. 
Wow never seen this before!
Ôªø
the food chain..... it has broken the world is not working
"National Geographic has exclusive video of a jaguar taking down a caiman in Brazil's Pantanal wetlands, photos of which went viral earlier this month."-Video description.
In Top lane we have Nidalee vs Renekon AFK. GG Renekton
actually, Brazil..
In the amazonian jungle the jaguar is on the top of the food chain...he kills and eats caymans and anacondas pretty easy...reptiles can't go along with the reflexes and stealth of a huge cat...i've seen house cats killing VENOMOUS snakes
looks like the Lion is not the king of the jungle anymore....
Wow. 
Meanwhile in Australia...
Screw you food chain! 
Yeah, but the biggest part is in Brazil, Amazon makes 50% of Brazilian territory and since Brazil is 5th biggest country in the world, the chances are pretty high
its not necessarily Brasil, you know? It could be Venezuela, a big part of the Amazons is located there too.
BOSS!
Dam nature, you scary
no
Gj Renekton you forgot to ward the river and now you fed nidalee. Wtf is this bronze 5?
Nature.
That was not a goddamn crocodile, as the guy in the video says it is a caiman, there are huge differences between a caiman and a crocodile.
That's impressive. Do jaguars do this often or only if they haven't had food for a while? It seems like a rather dangerous prey to me, even if they're pretty helpless when attacked from behind.
dont be a thumb up whore makes you look sad and desperate for attention. no duh people are watching this off the fine bros playlist that just came out today... dunce.
QQ combo out of ult

LOL
Damn nature! You scary!
So relatable to jaguars!!
That's a very cool video of an efficient predator (the jaguar) in action.
14,000 comments LOL, never has so little said my so many 
Cool neck kill, My dog does the same when he hunts
increible.... paciente y sigiloso como buen depredador... pero increible como lo atrapa y no lo suelta. cosas de la naturaleza..... 
Majestic animal (Jaguar)
Nature is living way before we were here so we don't have rights to judge Nature is threatening or cruel to our society or other animals. Animals living for survival at least they have their instinct job to do. On the other hand, Humans is the most cruel on the face of the earth because we have brains and do not know how to use it. :D
Amazing............. 
And yet Jag - you-are is the correct pronunciation. It's no big deal, different countries pronouce things differently, That's just one that kinda annoys me. That and the way you guys ( assuming you're american?) say aloominum instead of al-you-min-e-um. Still, I guess it's the same for people in the U.S in that our way of saying it sounds weird to them.
Jagwar is a better pronunciation than jagwire
sou apaixonado pelos felinos, s√£o precisos, silenciosos, r√°pidos, musculosos e dentes super afiadas.Ôªø
I thought Tiger was the most aquatic not Jaguar...

i like
That's Chuck Norris car xD
Ese es el gato q se le escapo a Chuck Norris xD
los tiene bien puestos ... es mi idolo 
el cocodrilo le puede dar mecha , lo que susedio eske el jaguar tuvo la suerte de meter sus dientes en la parte superior del hocico del cocodrilo esa zona del cocodrilo es tan debil k hasta un hombre con un solo dedo impide k el cocodrilo levante el hocico, es por eso k el cocodrilo no podra hacer nada hasta k el jaguar se descuide y suelte por un momento el hocico del cocodrilo es ahy donde se armara la mecha hasta k no le agarre en la misma zona k el jaguar ignora ;) 
umm don't u guys know that jaguar always hunt croc.
Nature is so cruel... And we can't change that for now, we only can don't let cats kill smal animals (and we kept them far from posion).
Doesn't make it any less relevant! =P

Cept jaguars live in south america, whereas nile crocs live in africa. Nice try, retard.
An adult lion would never mess with an adult croc if it were by itself. Maybe if it were with its pride but by itself it would be lunch.
What an amazing video! 
Like number 85341 (:
A JAGUAR CAN EASILY KILL A NILE CROC. A JAGUAR TAKES A FEW MINUTES TO KILL A 300 POUND 30 FOOT ANACONDA LET ALONE A NILE CROC
I'm stating my opinion, I'm not trying to impress anyone. That's just how I feel about life and about the other humans around me. " in a few billion years and the earth will cease to exist.. until then, live it up til you take your dirt nap" Right and seeing as how the human species are only about 200K years old think of how far we can go in that few billion years. No way we even make it close to that on our current path of not giving a crap. Thanks for making my point for me.
i had dreams about this O_O
Don't be that person.. just saying stuff to try and sound deep.. the sun will burn out in a few billion years and the earth will cease to exist.. until then, live it up til you take your dirt nap

If this jaguar were to take on a full-grown Nile Crocodile, he would be toast. 
jagwaaaaaarr 
Continued... Its just not about how we act or if you recycle or any of that. Our very existence and the fact we won't check our population or destruction of everything in the name of is the problem. We will continue to be a stain on this planet till we destroy it and us along with it imo. 
You are misunderstanding me. I'm saying every single person by default is a horrible creature. If you are taking part in modern society you have already done damage. What happens when the deer get over populated ? When they start destroying the land, taking up all the resources and killing all the other animals that live there. We cull them. We kill them down to a level that the environment can support. What do we do with people ? Bang out 20 more where that came from. Only China limits it.
Amazing stuff. Fast food take-away.
Um, no. Predators get eaten by other predators all the time. Predators just have to have prey in order to be considered predators.

SouthAmericanSon is correct, Caiman are are in the Alligatridae family while Crocodiles are in the Crocodylidae family. Not to be confused with the Order Crocodylia of which both families are members.

Feeling sorry for the Caiman, who would have thunk it ;)
he can carry that motherfucker with his teeth O.O? 
Over used. =__=
That was over quick
Might want to recheck your info. Just tried to verify what you said but every source I found showed saltwater and Nile crocodiles having by far the highest biteforce and actually showed the Jaguar ahead of the Hippo with a 2000 psi bite compared to 1800 psi for the hippo.
Risky for the jaguar if a croc was watching him as he entered the water, ball would be in the crocs court. Gotta take risks for food in the wild though.
wow they jaguar is a beast
Savage strength
Naturalny Hitman 
hippos have afaik a larger biteforce than crocodiles
the jaguar just wanted a crocodile coat :c 
V nice video
Awesome! That was totally ninja!

wooooooowwwww!!!!! that's awesome!!
Apocalypto Show Returns
...Jaguars have one of the most powerful jaws of the entire animal kingdom, even more powerful than a Lion, Tiger, Hyena or Wolf. The only animal with a larger biteforce is ironically the Crocodile. 
OOOO :D
Incredible. Fantastic video
An a adult lion will fuck up a croc
waw 
Awesome video.. Love the Jaguar.
Pretty cool... though an adult crocodile would have crushed that jaguar to bits.

Predator's don't get eaten. Once something is eaten, by definition it is prey, and no longer predator.

Octopus' Fish can kill and eat Sharks as well. ; ) And then: Many People don't know how many Birds - are killing smaller Birds. Nature has huge Assets of Predator Animals as it's Desposal, who are about literally killing Machines. x) One Thing i can immediately think of as the greatest Killer - is the Spider. They are Cannibals that WILL instantly attack any, other Spider, that comes into Range, as soon as they are matured enough. Even the own "Family" isn't an Exception ... ... ; )
Good job!!

Not all of us Humans are such Trash that must get taken down. Some, or many, or even "most" of us are okay People nobody need to castigate into Submission. And by the Way: Most of our Kind's " Asshole-Phase " ends when we reach the Age of about 20 Years. Before: Many of us need to recieve a good Beating sometimes - ESPECIALLY the Bullies. But most of us are good, proper Beings, no One needs to tame.

Still, honey badger doesnt give a fuck
Crikey! 
why didn't you show it tearing apart the crock. you show the crocks tearing away at poor little zebras. anyways here what should have happened the cat eating the crock on that small sand bar, then when it goes to cross back, other crocks eating it. cuz i hate both species
what an awesome job this would be to have
human is no doubt one of them!
I could say the same about a lot of people, to bad we can't apply that same logic right. 
Still gots nothing on honey badger!
wtf? 
I wouldn't want Jaguars running around my neighborhood.

damn! dat jaguar nasty!
No such animal as a panther, they don't exist, true story lol. 
I'm a human being. :-) I'm goin out on a limb and say you haven't raped,pillaged,or destroyed.If that's true then that will make 2 of us.You are not responsible for the horrible acts of others.You are an individual who is aware of the wrongs in the world.You also work to right the wrongs in the world that you can.As primates with this awareness we try every day to improve ourselves,and each other through example.Your worded concerns change the actions of others who see your life. I love you. 
Esse √© o nosso pantanal matogrossense seus gringo safado kkkkkkkk venh√£o conhecer e mor√£o de medinho !
Unless you live off the land without creating any carbon footprint whatsoever then its you and I are who I am talking about. Humans be default are destructive, even the most innocent and peaceful ones. The chairs we are sitting in and the computer we are communicating with, just think about what destruction it took to get that. How many acres of land and animals some human destroyed in the name of building society. Eventually we will run out of room, resources and then time. What can you do.
that would make one hell of an exotic pet!
only an old and experienced hunter gets the chance to kill a lion, since most young full sized crocs get eaten by lion prides. 
Y yo creia que estaba loco por hacercarse por el agua.increible!!!
You can't finish a presidency without becoming one

That guy sounds like he was once a sports commentator but then decided he like animals better.
You're describing a very very small percentage of humans, most of us just want to exist peacefully and be happy.
I'm a human. :-)Now I'm goin out on a limb and say that you haven't raped,pillaged,or destroyed.If that's true that will make two of us.That being said I'll also guess you help more bad situations get better then make them worse.You are not responsible for the horrible acts of others.You are an individual who is aware of injustice in the world around you,and are working to make these wrongs right.As primates with this awareness we work to end more pain and suffering within our reach.I love you.

But then, of course, a hippo can bite a crocodile in half.
It attacked a CAIMAN, not a croc. A crocodile could drag a jaguar to its death; besides, they don't live in South America like jaguars do. Crocs can eat lions, zebras, buffalo, and hippos, so I wouldn't mess with one.
WOW!!!
THAT SNEAKY BASTARD!!!!!

This was actually a female Jaguar taking revenge after her cub was murdered by a Croc.
They make good cars, too.
What are you ? lol. Nah all we do as humans is rape, pillage and destroy..everything. One day we will even do it to us too because we are that ignorant. Our biggest downfall is the high opinion we have of our stupidly primate biology imo.
^win
Out freakin standing video.Reports abound of these big cats in parts of north America. Recently in Colorado a U.S. parks dept. field cam caught 2 separate jaguars in the southern portion of the state.The cats were over 70+ miles away from each other photoed by two different cameras. Reports of black leopards still get filled every year around the Gulf states,and the East cost Puma(Cougar) is often reported in the area from eastern Texas to Maine. 
most of your species save life. except those who are pro abortion. 
Jaguar Attacks CrocodileÔªø
The sad thing is Jaguars used to be indigenous to the whole southern part of the united states from Florida all the way to California as late as the early 1900s. Human ignorance and needless killing wiped them out however, I hate the species I belong too sometimes.
Damn nature, I was like damn nature, you scary.
Damn nature, you scary
LOL! Funny stuff man i love playing league of legends.

Jaguar = On√ßa Pintada 
I have no idea what these top comments stand for.

Good job guys 
It is referred as Jaguar in the English language.
Pantanal Matogrossense! MT- love this such awe nature!
Damn comment. You unoriginal!
Damn nature. You SCARY!
this is not one leopard or jaguar is 1 ON√áA PINTADA
by their fur and size, also their living enviroments, the jaguar (Panthera Onca) On√ßa in Brazil, it's the biggest feline in americas, and the leopard (Panthera Pardus) can be found in Africa and Asia. in other words the leopard is smaller and less muscular than a jaguar.

This is not a Leopard, this is an Jaguar, but is not an Crocodile, is an alligator. --'
Damn nature... eh fuggit
no it's really a jaguar in brazil it's called On√ßa (Panthera Onca), and the crocodile it's actually a kind of alligator it's too small to be a crocodile... in brazil (Jacar√©) :)
Still they are not the same animal, it's like comparing a domestic cat with a Cheetah, they are both Felines, but they are not the same animal
*Isn't *Leopard. No. There are no ''Leopards" in Brazil....
slap yourself.

Nidalee win top line to renekton afk. Elohell.
nunca habia visto algo asi xD
Xblaque vs Sobek
How do you differentiate between a Jaguar and a Leopard ?
Thats the title, i don't give a damn about the title, the guy in the video said caiman. They wrote ''Crocodile" in the title so the video would get more views, cause no one knows what a caiman is.
The strongest crocodile are Nile crocodile that lifes in Africa You cant compare Nile Crocodile with Caiman
uhaehueahuea, Perdoe eles Senhor, eles n√£o sabem o que fazem!
No they are not. They are both part of the crocodilian family.
That was cool

How does a Nidalee get FB on a Renekton.
In the title:Jaguar Attacks CROCODILE -.-'
First blood Nidalee...... afk Renekton!!! 
holy shit
On√ßa em ingl√™s √© jaguar!! animal de carro√ßa!!
I would argue, but since you heard it from mr. Irwin, I will take it as the truth and nothing but the truth. 
how could you tell that? LOL 
Pls Report Renekton Feed Nidalee
Quanto ao crocodilo, voc√™ est√° correto. Mas quanto ao Jaguar, saiba que esse √© um outro nome para a on√ßa pintada.
Thats such a beautiful jaguar : ]
crocodile and caiman are two completely different animals :/
pra mim √© um gato e uma lagartixa.

HOLY SHIT! damn nature^^.. that jaguar is freaking badass :D
Aqui ta outro detalhe, o cara falou "Caiman", que em portugues seria jacare, e Onca Pintada, em ingles e Jaguar, tenha um pouco de cultura senhor
Other croc ditched his buddy lol
HE SAID CAIMAN YOU DUMBASS
Fuck you too, pal.
SEU IDIOTA O CARA FALOU ''CAIMAN", ISSO TRADUZ PRA JACARE EM PORTUGUES, E ONCA E JAGUAR EM INGLES, APRENDA A SER MENOS IGNORANTE NA PROXIMA VEZ
Crocodiles in Brazil? Where?

It¬¥s a Alligator, not a Crocodile!! The only specie of crocodile of the south america lives in Venezuela, its scientific name is Crocodylus intermedius.
Wuuaooo
How can people dislike his video? That attack is very special and it is good clear footage of it. I dont know what they were expecting

To me, hyper-dramatic narrators take away from the excitement. This guy was perfect... he was genuinely excited instead of fake excited, and sounded like a real person.
I had to google that but it was worth it. Thumbs up.
holyyyy....that was nuts lol
crocodile =/= caiman lol... let it jump on an actual CROC! 1000 pounds? 2000 pounds?
wtf!? Alligator at breakfast, elephant at evening meal.... 
awsome :) /)
this isn't Jaguar, this correct is ON√áA
NO BRASIL N√ÉO H√Å JAGUAR NEM CROCODILO, √â UM JACAR√â E UMA ON√áA, AMERICANOS BURROS 
And Jaguars are slowly coming back to the US. XD Neat huh?
Fucking renekton, afk
That jaguar is a beast! I never realised how powerful they are, amazing.
DAMN NATURE! YOU SCARY!
I'm glad he nonchalantly narrated this video like it was no big deal. I was almost impressed. *sarcasm* :^)
like a ninja 
Poor alligator , but oh well
Se eu fosse o Jaguar eu ia dar uma metidinha no crocodilo antes de me alimentar da carne dele.
so is an alligator. :P Caiman's are of the three classes in the crocadilian *family* but they aren't crocodiles. Crocs are the largest of the three, whereas caimans are the smallest. Crocodiles are at the top of their food chain, where clearly caimans are not. I learned all this from the one, the only, Steve Irwin, The Crocodile Hunter. Wikipedia is written by any idiot who thinks they know more about the last idiot, and actually becomes less reliable the more popular the subject matter.
Now THAT is a predator!
Awesome

what do you mean a croc is mainly a aquatic animal and it hunts out of water and in this case the caiman was ut of water and that explains why it was killed by this jaguar

no animal can kill a jaguar that easy
crocodiles don't eat catfood
The name is a misnomer. A caiman is a dwarf crocodilian at two metres compared to Saltwater crocodiles that are up to six metres long. That Jaguar would have been "catfood" if it dared attack a full-sized croc.

The problem is it's not a croc. It's a caiman. They're not very aggressive. I've seen my dad swim a few feet near caiman. They rather flee then fight, unlike they're cousins.

you meant "panther".
like a "painted jaguar" :) 
Excuse us, mister "i've traveled the wolrd for the last 40 years"

who asked you for the Portuguese translation ?

√© uma Panthera onca e n√£o deixa de ser um jaguar...
Actually both are right, because that's the American popular name for this species, which makes sense as it is still endemic in American territory. The "crocodile" naming is the most inaccurate, as there's no crocodiles in Brazilian territory.
Jacar√© is Crocodile for americans... and the really crocodile is Aligator
JAGUAR WINS!!!
Cara em Ingl√™s e Jaguar e Crocodile e Jacar√© pra eles 
Cool !!! I guess i better not piss off my gf's house cat anymore....yikes !!
Isto n√£o √© um jaguar e sim uma on√ßa pintada e n√£o, n√£o √© um crocodilo e sim um jacar√© 
No. Voce esta errado. Se llama jaguar. El √∫nico pa√≠s que llama "on√ßa pintada" es Brasil. XD En spanish and enlgish es jaguar.

Damn nature! You scary!
You are wrong. Crocodiles (Crocodilia) are separated into Brevirostres and Gacialidiae. Brevirostres then are separated into Alligatoroidea and Crocodyloidea. The Caiman belongs to the Alligatoroidea. So you can say that he is a crocodile because his order is crocodilia...
My cat dragged an adult rabbit in front of my doorstep... still alive!
WOW! That was some awesome footage! If I had to reincarnate as something other than human it would definitely be of the feline persuasion. Most people would probably choose a bird of some kind, which would be my number two choice(something huge). But you have to ask yourself how many times have you seen a cat with a bird in it's mouth? For me, it's a lot. Felines are truly incredible land creatures. 
DesceALetra ? HUEHUE
Well, a fed Nidalee can kill also a Reneton.
you are 38 years old and have been traveling for the past 40 years... (y)

They are separated into Crocodiles Alligators Caimans 
Considerando que o cidad√£o est√° filmando no Brasil, isso n√£o √© um jaguar e sim uma on√ßa, e aquilo, nunca, mas nunca poderia ser um crocodilo e sim um jacar√©.
A on√ßa-pintada (nome cient√≠fico: Panthera onca), tamb√©m conhecida por pintada, on√ßa-verdadeira, JAGUAR. Brazucas brazucando. 
One simple view at wikipedia and I know youre wrong. "Caimans are alligatorid crocodylians within Caimaninae"
nope, wouldnt f*** wit dat 1
They are caiman, not crocodiles. The title is inaccurate.
Jaguar?? S√©rio?
N√£o √© um v√≠deo para o Brasil.

Is not a "jaguar", we call "on√ßa pintada"... 
O t√≠tulo correto seria: On√ßa-Pintada atacando Jacar√©
Lol
True mate! 
But leopards also hunt prey much bigger than themsleves like zebras, so would that compensate for the difference in size between them if they fought?

you're such a troll
that croc was about 12 feet. there are not much bigger crocs that that one
Can't help but feel a bit sorry for that slippery fellow
A bigger croc would've also get hunted. stop trolling
what's your point? That jaguars are not so tough? Get out of here. It would've been the same 
it's on youtube. Search for it

Damn nature, you scary!
one thing, hippos live in africa. jaguars in the americas. and yes the hippo would probably win. besides this "small croc" is a caiman which is longer than the jaguar, and have a ferocious bite..
I've seen cats beating dogs, lions killing hyenas and elephants, pumas beating bears and jaguars killing caimans and anacondas. Who the hell knows my friend... cats are such amazing hunters
What the fuck are you talking about???
OMG that jaguar is incredible... no fear at all.
I think my comment is still here if you can find it, but when this video had like 30.000 views I said it's gonna be viral ;)
bombing things doesn't solve anything fucking moron, do the world a favour and die
This is the first nat geo vid in a long time that deserved to be uploaded.
Bodo blako hok ado sini..natam..
I allways thought crocodiles, alligators and caimans are like invincible...
This is not a crocodile. There are no wild crocodiles in South America. This is a caiman (South American relative of the alligator).
so what happening next?? does the Jaguar have it ?
this video is about a jaguar eating a crocodile, why the fuck are you guys talking about religion?

Awesome, but too bad the video suddenly stops. I would like to see if the jaguar can handle the croc when he gets back in the water.....
a small croc is one thing but what if it was a large Hippo?Would Hippo win?
That is remarkable. It could do the same to me. What a dangerous predator.
It's not a crocodile,it is cayman . Crocodile would eat jaguar ))

Oddly enough, I'm feeling hungry right now.

I suppose If you were confronted by a caiman, and all you had was a 8 inch blade, the back of his head should be your target.

caiman is a type of crocodile check Wikipedia 
so wt does the Jaguar say?

"certainly the most aquatic of the big cats" tigers are in the water a lot more than jaguars....
video title says crocodile, camera guy says caiman. Nice one, NatGeo.

anyone else just searched for "video" ?
He read it on wikipedia

Who told Jaguar, where the nervous system of crocodiles are?
HUNT OR BE HUNTED !!!
Jaguar : Sorry Crocodile Fuck You
Cont ... Given I don't think I'd like to see what would happen between a Jaguar and a Bull Salty, those things are double the size and more than double the weight of a caiman ... I'm sure if the Jaguar was hungry enough it'd give it ago, and if it was on land (those things aren't so fast on land as in water - in water, Jaguar loses no doubt, on land, fairer fight), but you're likely right, it wouldn't get the same result from an Bull Salty, definitely not as easy a kill ... (shutting up now)
I'm not sure it was an adult, it was definitely at least a juvenile, but I'd lean towards adult. That was no baby, nor was it a Salty, it was a caiman, different type of croc dude. I'm not sure which type of Caiman it was (I don't care enough to find out) but those crocs vary at adult size from 1-4 metres depending on the species. Given a Jaguar is around 1-2 metres nose to tail, & that caiman was about the same length, I'd guess adult & even if not, I'd say yeah it could take the adults anyway.
The Jaguar totally unplugged that Caiman, soon as it bit on it, it didn't move, lights off.
:OÔªø
Now, who's the king of the river? And it can't be the other way around, you just CAN"T sneak upon a jaguar.....

Poor Crocodile 
try doing it and then tell us how it is not impressive
Title is misleading. Firstly, it's not a croc it's a caiman. Secondly, taking out a 7 foot caiman by surprise is not impressive at all.
it's really awesome!!!
report mid no say ss

lol
Yeah, but this was not a fight per se
Amazing !
like this comment and press 1337
look up 'soccer stadium sound effect' and play both videos simultaneously
i guess its jaws are even stronger :p
que clase de caiman es ese si fuera uno con sentido le daba con la cola lo dejaba atontado y le metia un mordisco que rebentaba al jaguar
That is a caiman, not a crocodile. Which is a member of the crocodilian species (actually a subspecies of the aligatoridea) just like the true crocodiles, alligators and gharials. Very impressive that the jaguar is able to bite trough the skin, which is very tough. Quite uncommon for predators to feed on other predators. This fight could have went the other way if the caiman saw the jaguar.
Votetm
how can he kill him??? crocodile skin its really strong 
Beautiful attack. It's not uncommon for a jaguar to kill crocs, even in the water
Oh SHit!!
Wonderful
had to see it to believe it

Nature is unpredictable, fine by National geografic by these shocking images
you just made my day, sir.
you just made my day, sir.
damn, i was shocked when the jaguar started by hunting the crocodile...
Bien por el leopardo.
as a matter of fact, i do. and since irony is not a number, hence not exact, one might say that something is ironic while someone else will say that it's not. which is exactly what happened here. thank you.
I don't think you know the definition of "irony".
Valla parida
oh irony, i got an advert for national geographic before the video :P
crocodile was sick.
what an fight of two great fighters 
I feel like i could commentate an ant taking a bread crumb after this. " now that ant is really moving without hesitation and the breadcrumb is totally unaware it is being stalked...."
Yeah nice hunting
This sounds like a sport commentary...
damn this Jag has power!!! unbelieveble how quick he finished that Kaiman!!
hAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHHAHAHAHAAHHAAHAHAH LOL
Published on Sep 26, 2013When a jaguar pounces, sometimes one bite is all it takes to get a meal. National Geographic has exclusive video of a jaguar taking down a caiman in Brazil's Pantanal wetlands, photos of which went viral earlier this month. Luke Dollar, a conservation scientist who helps manage National Geographic's Big Cats Initiative, explains the hunt and explosive moment of predation.Ôªø
JAGUAR FINALITY !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Believe that Jesus Christ is your savior for all your sins. If you truly believe in Jesus Christ to be your savior for all your sins then you will go to Heaven. If you believe in Jesus Christ then you are saved and you are in salvation and you have gained God's righteousness. It matters not how much you have sinned in the past, in the present and especially in the future. Believe that Jesus Christ is your savior and you will go to Heaven forever and that is the whole truth. Spread the truth.
Fuck Zebras. I'll hunt a crocodile

Esto fue un ataque sorpresa, si se le fuera de frente creo que no le seria tan f√°cil, siria lo mismo si el caim√°n lo cogiera tomando agua en el rio(ataca desde abajo del agua) seria una victoria para el caim√°n, pero no significa que sea mas fuerte

And what's the end of the story? Just because the jaguar with the crocodile to start in the water... (1:52)
nice documentation indeed....carnivore vs carnivore.... 
It snapped the caiman's spinal cord, don't you see it getting paralyzed? It's limbs went limp, it's not going to do any death rolls...and there aren't any Hippos in the Americas, only in Africa. And since they're solitary hunters, if they did live in the same habitat a Jaguar wouldn't stand a chance against a Hippo.
Awesome, never seen that before.

And God has created every animal from water: of them there are some that creep on their bellies; some that walk on two legs: and some that walk on four. God creates what He wills; for verily God has power over all things." (Qur'an 24:45)

Amazing that the crocodile could not sense that the jaguar came off the water. Must be deep in sleep! haha The kill was extremly well shot by the camera man. nice post.
doesnt matter, he was french. (youtube -> renekton im french)
what you propose is arbitrage and that does not exist and if it did, you would not tell it to anyone else, otherwise arbitrage opportunities would be gone in an instant because everyone would do what you do and the earnings would fall dramatically. dont post lies here.

you don't know the difference between North America and South America do you? you should check out a world map my friend.
El jaguar despu√©s de cazar al lagarto regresa por el agua, por que no ponen esa parte dudo que el lagarto dentro de su h√°bitat (osea el agua) siga siendo presa.
its still technically called North America, we're all technically North American, but I see what you're getting at, and I feel silly for leaving out Mexico, didn't mean it wasnt a part lol

DAMN NATURE YOU SCARY!
Esto no es un comportamiento normal ,el calentamiento global esta causando un desequilibrio ambiental ,al parecer el jaguar al no encontrar alimento tuvo que hacer esto en un acto desesperado por sobrevivir.
son muy listos y sin duda depredadores por excelencia. 
Okay, that's it! The jaguar is now my favorite animal!
ŸÉÿ≤ŸÇ ÿßŸÜÿ™ ŸàŸäÿßŸáŸá
asi se ve mi gato cazando lagartijas!!!!...XD
Did the national geographic actually just call the skull a brain case?
Report Renekton for feeding Nidalee!
extraordinario! 
Not so sure about a tiger killing gustave. That croc was probably well over 2000 pounds. Look at Lolong. 20.3 feet long, 2300 pounds. You think a 500 pound cat has a chance? Even a tail whip from an animal like that could kill a tiger. 
Hopefully the more that see this the more are educated about the conservation of these majestic beasts. 
Probably to draw more people to it. They are neither definitively croc nor alligator. but yeah, this video is awesome. I too want to see what happens after they cut it off.....
renketon feeds nidalee first blood gg

ajaajaajjaajajajajajaajajajaajajajajajajajajajajaaaja
Acaso tu tienes la culpa por comerte a tantos animales en lo que has vivido ? el caiman tiene que matar para comer, igual tu, igual yo, todos tenemos que matar para sobrevivir, en ese caso los 2 animales son hermosos, porque es parte de la naturaleza el devorar y el ser devorado o vivir otro dia mas para morir saludos
que hermoso jaguar ya era hora que este reptil pagara por todo lo malo que a hecho comiendo a tantas presas , buena estocada colmillal le propino mi AMIGO EL JAGUAR

Fair points for the most part. Then things got out of hand. Cyrus retweeted an image from an account that used to belong to Sinead O‚ÄôConnor alluding to her mental state.

They're both spotted cats, but they are different cats, same as a cheetah and a leopard are different :) Or a Persian and a Siamese ... belong to the same family (cats) but different species. They are very closely related, obviously, but have evolved in different direction due to being in vastly different environments.

First: you can't let anybody tries to change who you are. If someone does, walk away. Plus, that's not something you change just like that. Either you belive or you don't. Second: religions are the biggest shit in this world. All they do is dividing people. Just be a good person, don't need no religion to be a good person and knowing what's right or wrong in life.

Nida counter renek 3 OP
check this out you will see what im talking about an this is a bengal tiger its half the size of the siberian tiger /watch?v=8Wi5mR-kWM8
ya i know Gustave he was a big boy but this is the thing in the water obviously the croc wins because the tiger cant use its claw or teeth efficiently it has to focus on swimming but you but the siberian tiger on land with Gustave its no contest the croc is to slow the tiger will hope on his back an bite the back of his head an no more Gustave would be a crazy fight, the things is all crocs only have one weapon an there slow on land compared to other apex predators,but this is just my opinion

Impresionante! de no pensar, se dieron vuelta los papeles parece.... 
Wow
Realmente es la primera vez que veo un jaguar alimentarse de un caim√°n, y por lo visto y por su t√©cnica , no es la primera vez. Lo que ,e hace pensar que en su territorio le est√°n faltando sus presas naturales. Todo es una cadena, y la caza furtiva, las madereras y las quemas para hacer de la floresta pasto para ganado, est√° destruyendo la fauna natural en Brasil. La corrupci√≥n y el poder es tan grande que cada vez que se alza una voz o una persona para denunciarlos e intentar pararlos, termina muerta. Esto deber√≠a ser tomado muy en serio por las naciones, y no quedarse en el trabajo de algunas personas que arriesgan hasta su vida para detenerlo.  Ôªø

A caiman is not a crocodile. It is more of an alligator. Crocs are much bigger and more powerful than these overgrown lizards.

Hi ,pls view my video called I come alive ,by Verushka,I really appreciate ur support,thankyou,I love you all
A M A Z I N G!!! I love this video :)
yes it is amazing, but the jaguar would have been hamburger meat if it tried to attack in inside the water. I lived in Africa and I know for a fact that lions do act all tough when they are on land but they never dare to enter the wild rivers if they know there is a crocodile. It takes one crocodile to take down a zebra and shred it to pieces in a span of one minute, whereas it takes a herd of lions to take down one zebra and lock it to the ground before even tearing it.
lol 
Now I see my cat with more respect
That's insane...
fuck the honey badger! this jaguar is awesome
Let's find that jaguar. I need a new suit
mic! jaguar swipe!!!
Nice job cat
That was it. That was the entire fight. He severed the croc's central nervous system, rendering it paralysed.
Racist.
replace the croc with Bieber and this vid gonna have 50 billion views at least
El cocodrilo estaba revisando su Twitter. 
Fuck yeah
that aweasome!
increible!!!!!! 
wow.....watch more video / gossip in desicinemaa.....desicinemaa...desicinemaa...desicinemaa...desicinemaa....
el leopardo dijo antes que me mate este, mejor primero yo lo mato
Que injusto lo agarro tomando sol y de espaldas jaja :(
para sobrevivir hay q arriesgar la propia vida ,buen recurso .
Surprise madafaka!!
Una vez vi algo parecido en la smazonia peruana pero con un caiman bebe y el jaguar se lo llevo mucho mas f√°cil
Good!
Is really Amazing..... Cool Video...
frien zone 
Hola
That is really amazing, not something I expected from a Jaguar. I really enjoy this youtube channel since it allows me to learn something new all the time. I still cant get over how fast it was and how quickly he had his prey under his control.
el hambre si es canija XD
amazing the nature!!!!!!!!

Now if only Jaguars could take out a few million white people. I'd pay to watch that video.....
hunter hunted like (Y) 
Holy shit that was awesome
la naturaleza tiene muchas sorpresas( esto si es una sopresa jajjaj)
La carne de caiman se parece a la pechuga del pollo, el jaguar se come la pulpa que se encuentra mas en la parte del cuello y espalda. Hasta la gente come caiman.
muy bueno
Jajaja este video es realmente increible.
Est√° muy gordo, lo raro es que trata de comerse algo que es casi incomestible, me parece que puede ser un ejemplar que estuvo en cautiverio, porque esta muy gordo y un cocodrilo es algo que un felino no trataria de comer en condiciones normales
Y para que crees que lo casa? para adoptarlo ? que lento eres...
Un cazador profesional..!
Jaguar vs. cayman: Awesome! #NationalGeographicÔªø
Si el jaguar supiera lo famoso que es ahora ya hubiera reclamado derechos de autor al que subi√≥ el video.
para mi que el leopardo tenia que hacer un rito de iniciaci√≥n para que sus amigos lo acepten el reto era cazar un caiman jajajja
"JAGUAR" VS. "LaCoste"

omg report renek, gg nidalee
awesome, watch the second part in my channel. greetings
y depredador de cocodrilos :O
Magnifique
esos animales llevan millones de a√±os evolucionando para llegar a lo que son hoy. si le tiras lechugas a un jaguar o un cocodrilo no la va comer por ellos evolucionaron asi.
Just an english guy passing through...
tigre versus cocodrilo ¬° ganador ! tigre
cual es la ideologia de uds?? no comer a otro ser vivo?? supongo q por eso algunos no comen pescado, como hacen los indues???
My favourite animal to draw is the liger.. It's a cross between a lion and a tiger..
ahora el jaguar comera sushiiiiiiiiiiiiii!!!!!!!!!! kajkajkaj
obvio que cada quien coma lo que quiera. pero ojo los humanos no somos carnivoros somos omn√≠voros. por eso podemos comer carne, frutos, tuberculos y vegetales.
Nadie sabe qu√© pas√≥ al final pues la piel del reptil es bastante resistente y el video no permite ver qu√© m√°s sucede.
Many of us would've probably placed the bet on the kaiman, and lost.
No, they hugged and went for a coffee together.
ÿ™ÿßŸäŸÇÿ±
to be honest dude it all depends on the animal every conflict would have a different outcome me personally the siberian tiger is my favourite animal an i believe any snake or any animal for that fact would lose to the siberian tiger there the undisputed king, but in the end all these apex predators are amazing in there own way so there is no need to dispute by the sounds of it your a reptile guy an im a cat guy so were gonna argue till were blue in the face regardless there both awesome animals
Wow what happened was the crocodile killed?
me gusta el gatito lastima que no es para domesticar

Damn nature, you scary!
.....? Eso no es m√°s que una postura personal, pero eso NO te hace m√°s civilizado, deber√≠as revisar la definici√≥n de ser "civilizado" antes de comentar cuestiones netamente morales. Segundo, las plantas puede que no tengan un sistema nervioso, pero es aterrante la doble moral de los vegetarianos, toman por excusa evitar el sufrimiento y el dolor, pero ven un hormiguero o zancudos, o cucarachas y sin miedo van y les ponen la sandalia encima jajajaja.
WoW !!! Now that is effectiveness at its best !

holy shit!
La naturaleza ni se equivoca ni acierta, funciona por selecci√≥n natural. Los seres irracionales hacen lo que tengan que hacer para sobrevivir. Yo como ser humano civilizado no deseo que la selecci√≥n natural reglamente nuestra civilizaci√≥n. Como seres civilizados, no nos comemos unos a otros, evitamos el dolor y el sufrimiento, pero caemos en ESPECISMO. Los animales igualmente sienten dolor, sufren, es algo abstracto, no humano; por ende, deber√≠amos evitar el dolor y el sufrimiento a otros seres.
isso tudo e fome √©?

Ese no es un cocodrilo es un CAIMAN, los cocodrilos s√≥lo viven en √Åfrica y Australia, un cocodrilo es m√°s fuerte y pesado que el caim√°n.

ENGLISH MUTHAFUCKER!!! DO U SPEAK IT!??
you have wrong.
Pero qu√© carajos hablas?...Para tener raz√≥n hay que hablar con fundamentos. Osea que los animales herb√≠boros carecen de dientes y muelas? Ant√≠lopes, cebras, vacas, etc. tienen una dentadura incluso m√°s fuerte que la nuestra. Los animales carn√≠voros est√°n dotados de colmillos mucho m√°s afilados que los nuestros y con una potencia de mordida superior. Tanto bif√© te tiene el cerebro aweonao...

Powerfull Jaguar(Y)
C un ouffff le jaguar
Los vegetarianos se expresan muy parecido a sectarios religiosos, se defienden y atacan a los que no piensan como ellos. Una cosa muy simple deseo expresar: La naturaleza no se equivoca, los seres humanos tienen dientes, muelas e incisivos, lo que demuestra que es un animal carn√≠voro. Ahora si alguien desea comer vegetales solamente ¬°bienvenido! no me molesta en lo absoluto, pero a m√≠ no me insulten ni me ataquen porque me gusta comer un buen bife de 400gr a la parrilla con papas fritas.
el hambre es cabrona
Damn Nature you Scary!!!!

Understood renekton? Ward your fking river , or nidalee will destroy you :(
This Jaguar is known to the locals as "Mick Jaguar" which just makes this video that much more awesome 
The title should reflect the description -- its a caiman, not a croc.
Jaguars are badass. In africa, a croc is number one in the foodchain, dont have to worry about any lions or leopards attacking. But here, jaguars rule the land and the rivers :D Very confident jag and just amazing footage! 
maybe cuz that jaguar was high?
eso es un intento de espa√±ol? o tus padres nunca te llevaron a la escuela?

- Good idea. - Agreed. - They did, but that was not part of their religion. Everyone did. - No, we have proven it wrong. Without our technology, it is a rational thing to think. - How to prove God? How to disprove God? I haven't a clue. Maybe indeed, in time it will be proven wrong, but right now it can't. - Science proves things. If you previously thought it was diferent, it is only logical to adapt to that. There's no weakness in acknowledging truth. This has nothing to do with religion either

I think it's not a question of the caiman being small or not, it's a matter of how definitely strong the jaguar bite is, through that rough skin to paralyze it so quick.

It's not like it looks... after some time crocodile called his pals and they knocked jaguar down... and then they had a good party with dead jaguar. LOL even i guess if they were FACE TO FACE jaguar would have no chance to win... 
Really incredible video of a Jaguar catching an Cayman. Remember that the Jaguar has the strongest biting force of all the cats. Funny thing is that the Jaguar could never do this in African waters because there are crocodiles up to maybe 6 meters. Still these cats are really relentless and incredible strong. I also ones seen a video of a very big snake trying to choke a not even adult tiger and it whas really useless for the snake. The snake couldn't do anything and the tiger whas just playing.

A jaguar that lives in south america will never encounter a crocodile. That's a cayman, which is already mentioned by the narrator. Caymans are much smaller than crocodiles.

That jaguar just carry a crocodile. Thats some massive power knowing that the crocodile is slightly larger than itself

Then you have not paid any heed to the audio.. The jaguar attacked the brain case of the crocodile making its central nervous system dis-functional. Thus no question of further attack by a brain dead crocodile.

Wow... I never thought a Jaguar would eat a Crocodile...
There was probably no fight, the way the Jaguar bit the Caiman, there was no way it had a chance of defending itself.

how Nidalee can kill Renekton ?
this is an animal video ...
Tastes like chicken.
Haha fuck a pitbull, mum I want a jaguar.
The crocodiles dislike this video, obviously.
I love this commentary, brings to mind, the comments given by the Olympic Judges, in the Diving events... '' and his footing is sure... hardly any splash.... he is doing a good job... but the camouflage is not working well... ah! there he goes! '' Point 9 and a half. ..
La parte debil del caiman es la cabeza si logras sostenerle la cabeza ya fue el caiman es presa facil.
qe buena 
Yummy.
lo mato de ley por ahy he visto otro video donde el cocodrlo ya esta muerto ni en el agua pudo con el jaguar
f 9
Obvious fake,man in a jaguar suit and if you look closely you will see the crocodile is simply a combination of mice,seaweed and superglue. The water is recreated with died white wine vinegertte and the trees are brought to life thanks to an ensamble of method acting from the cast of Police Academy.
ooohhhh! amazing i thought hippos and alligators are the kings of the swamps!
damnnn i want to be a jaguar 
haha the commentary made it feel like i was watching a sport. boom, one, two AND HE SINKS HIS TEETH IN!
pero lo llego a matar o no? por que la piel del cocodrilo es muy dura y el jaguar lo esta llevando en direcci√≥n al agua, donde el cocodrilo se vuelve mas fuerte y se hace mas √°gil

What the fuck has that got to do with a jaguar killing a fucking crocodile? All religion is bullshit, but let's stick to the fucking subject at hand, shall we? Jesus fucktard Christ!
other words from Al - Imran from the Quran And if they argue with thee, (O Muhammad), say: I have surrendered my purpose to Allah and (so have) those who follow me. And say unto those who have received the Scripture and those who read not: Have ye (too) surrendered? If they surrender, then truly they are rightly guided, and if they turn away, then it is thy duty only to convey the message (unto them). Allah is Seer of (His) bondmen. 
WOW!!!! Jaguar is so brave...

Oh kya seen ha

 He it is Who hath revealed unto thee (Muhammad) the Scripture wherein are clear revelations. They are the substance of the Book. and others (which are) allegorical. But those in whose hearts is doubt pursue, forsooth, that which is allegorical seeking (to cause) dissension by seeking to explain it. None knoweth its explanation save Allah. And those who are of sound instruction say: We believe therein; the whole is from our Lord; but only men of understanding really heed. 
 Lo! nothing in the earth or in the heavens is hidden from Allah. He it is who fashioneth you in the wombs as pleaseth Him. There is no God save Him, the Almighty, the Wise. 
y que tiene que ver eso con el video ? sos un desubicado 
I hate it that the nature is so brutal. So much suffering in the world.

LMFAO... seriously made my day hahaha...
 Aforetime, for a guidance to mankind; and hath revealed the Criterion (of right and wrong). Lo! those who disbelieve the revelations of Allah, theirs will be a heavy doom. Allah is Mighty, Able to Requite (the wrong).

Al-Imr√¢n In the Name of Allah, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful. Allah! There is no God save Him, the Alive, the Eternal. He hath revealed unto thee (Muhammad) the Scripture with truth, confirming that which was (revealed) before it, even as He revealed the Torah and the Gospel

Islam is a fake religion for one resone why god will send mohamad as a prophet and even he did not present any new for the humenbeen except the kill and the blood and the sex with children like aishaa he is 100% a false prophet he is the most sinner in the history how God his glory will make this a big mistake God is holy and everything from his glory holy too but mohamed is unclean he is murderer and thief and childeren rape

The crocodile didn't even use his PvP-trinket when he got stunned..
So this is the way to deffend yourself? by swearing? is this the virtue of a muslim, have you ever read mohamed's (peace be upon him) teaching about "kayd el koffar"? but this is what an egyptien can make. 
Haram, dont insult another's mother.
We're bigger than that. Lets reside in peace bro. 
for all of those who do not understand islam! first of all, the word islam in arabic means "to be subbmitted to the will of god". Those who are attacking islam by ignorance are the truly terrorists. just take a look, what does it mean to be terrorist? everyone who terrorise people is a damn terrorist. There's something I don't understand, this is video about two animals, why attacking islam? be who ever you want, but please don't hurt people because they are muslim. Just respect each other. 
One man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter. 
ahahaha renekton reported m8, you crack me up xD

incredibile
1800 Pounds isn't that big, that's well below a single ton(even if I think it's an exaggerated value), most big cats haven't even got big enoug theeth to pierce a real giant crocodiles armor.......The largest and strongest cat(siberian tiger) is not in the same habital as a saltwater or nile crocodile, so they never meet anyways......Similar mass of reptile muscle is about 4times stronger than mammal's, so they wouldn't even in the same class.....

fuckkk! i never though a jaguar have this strengh. amazing how rise the crocodile
an oversized skink with teeth
yep, the cayman is like the featherweight of the croc-like reptiles. The cat still would have won if it had to fight it head-on
Any big cat can take down any croc of any time. You can see tigress machli killing a 14 foot 1800 pounds croc in sundarbans where tigers hunt crocs and pythons for food

So its not impressive?
Yes, I agree also! However, in all fairness, they did mention this in their "About" section. Just some trickery at play here...

It depends on what crocodile species your are talking about... If you are talkiing about adult Nile's crocodile, you are right. But, Jaguar and Nile's crocodile don't live on the same continent...

M. ...
WTF.That was a caiman but still, to atack a reptile like this?OMG incredible.
pass by my channel, is complete, Greetings
Wow, never thought I'd see that! Perhaps it's just because I'm Australian, but Caiman are in the Alligatoridae family so they're Alligators (which are in the crocodylia Order, but not in the same Family as true crocodiles), so they are considerably smaller. Interestingly National Geographic didn't know this?
I looked at most of the feedback on here however I realize that's a brilliant clip. My older brother wants to become effective with gals. He learned a shit load from Master Attraction. (Google it if you want pretty good emails on picking up girls.) The support concerned with seducing women in night clubs in those emails through that site gave got him his very first sex in a couple of long yrs. I have been annoyed though coz I heard them all.
The sham is that there can't be more that 10,000 of those guys left.. And 10,000 is me being generous.

Huh.. And people think they know how to hunt.

You do know that the jaguar is more afraid of you than what you are afraid of him? If ANY animal attacks you it's just selfdefence. I don't think any animal WANTS to kill you, stay out of the way and you're good. Did you know that coconuts kill more people every year than a shark does?

Nidalee OP
Cool Jaguar !
feeding nidalee*
ÿ≥ÿ®ÿ≠ÿßŸÜ ÿßŸÑŸÑŸá
bad*ss jaguar! 
Actually, they're are very different, Caiman are in the Alligator family, so it's very misleading to refer to it as a crocodile.
El v√≠deo se atasca y no lo he podido ver. Una pena
I think the narrator should be more like the trailer guy.
Nidalee fed..
Different species/genus, both Australian species (fresh and saltwater) are somewhat larger (especially the saltwater) than the caiman
i m proud of that Jaguar
nidalee vs renekton?

great jagiii

Yes, man took years to learn that things die when struck/cut in the head/neck. :| 
Like a BOSS 
Dang that muthafucker run fast, dat thing come by my house, I'll kill iiit.
Unglaublich, die Herausforderungen steigen wohl auch im Tierreich - jetzt sind sogar die gepanzerten Tiere dran. Super Aufnahme als w√§re man selbst dort gewesen.
wats the difference between the CAIMAN and an Australian Crocodile?
Not for long lol
Weren't you listening? This is not some rare fight caught on camera. Jaguars actively hunt caiman, it's no different then watching a lion kill a wildebeest 
Woaw, that's the most famous jaguar in the world.
It would die just the same, there is nothing they can do when they get ambushed like that and especially out of the water. Nilo crocs don't fuck with lions either and when they do it's usually the lions that come out on top. Also that caiman is just as big as the jaguar. 
Renekton is feeding nidalee
Def. nidalees W E Q combo you can realy see the pounce swipe takedown
As opposed to most other American nature show narrators sounding like "Worlds most exiting police chases" douche nozzles. So good for him. 
buy wards please
Report Top. Renektons feeding Nidalee again.
No you can't blow them up^
report renekton for feeding plz
hay tiene comida como para rato.se paso el jaguar!!!
No. Man spent years mapping out it's pathways, naming them, and trying to prove this indubitably through reproducible experiments and analyses. Much like the jaguar, man was also able to learn of it's presence long ago. Beheadings are only one of the oldest forms of execution for this reason
NIDALEE OP NERF PLEASE.

The great jaguar!)
that jaguar has the biggest balls on the earth.
It's a damn shame that Jaguars are almost extinct

great tech great go go go Jaguar 
Minchia....!
This crocodile is just a small one, a full growth jaguar killed a young teen crocodile. 
The real horrible stuff is when human beings actually take these actions into real world. Otherwise, in the animal world, eat or be eaten. Even when we die, our bodies become food for ants and bugs. 
real pro...
think what you're trying to get at is evolution by natural selection. yeep, i agree, those jaguars have evolved nicely

at his convenience most definitely !!! 
I am watching this on my iPhone. Now I am hungry for some croc.
DAMN NATURE, YOU SCARY!!!
Man spent year to understand that there is a "Nervous System". The Jaguar instinctively knew there is one and was able to dig his teeth right into it to disable resistance. I believe this instinct was built-in so to speak and it was not learnt. It was by design. That designer is called god. 
Y el caim√°n que se ve al fondo en el islote emprendi√≥ la huida mejor!! Muy bueno

Jaguars and other cats are some of the most efficient predators in the wild.
A caiman is a pathetic version of a crocodile. Put a real croc in there and let's see it again. 
never cease to amaze us cats!!, I really liked the video!, thank you!
that jaguar is a pussy. cat
DAMN NATURE, YOU SCARY
Its not a crocodile...... Its a Caiman as per the narrator. 
First Time I have seen any Jaguar attacks on Crocodile..
that's because he seen things in his life, you haven't, except on youtube 
ahahahahaah.... idiota.
That is one effective hunter, for sure. The stalking, the fast attack and the precision when biting the alligator made a great combo to obtain an abundant meal. Good video!
DAMN! that was pretty awesome. Swimming like a boss.
Wow..
a salt water crocodile can snap that jaguar in half with a single bite
thank you

The evolution of the jaguar has started lol
look fairy tale boy,you can't say blabla and it will change nothing..action speaks and we have seen more of that than necessary to judge any religion and specifically the Islamic religion as Bullshit and better be put on the scrap pile of history
This is why big cats never cease to amaze me. They stalk and kill other predators that are efficient hunters in their own right. In the natural world, cats are the masters of the hunt. Amazing how similar they are to house cats stalking a toy. 
Superb
Amazing animal. I want to go there.
Not a croc.
maybe he would
Sick jag!
well the jaguar would hide the meal in the bushes and eat it there, would you want to go into the bushes with the jaguar? no you wouldn't.

El gobierno libera a 20 jaguares por las calles de Acapulco

amazing cat. it moves with stealth on land and water, you can't even hear a ripple. on land each step is like where bruce lee found his style of fighting,lol. and when it glides in the water , rises to pounce, all without the caymen knowing. wow, this is how a strike is supposed to be. Perfect ! only a creature can do that, no man comes close to such an attack and strike. fantastic vid, thanks.
Damn nature, you scary!
It's a fucking alligator lol.
balance of life I guess ?

The Hunter became the Hunted,,,,,
Yes, it's a caiman and not a "crocodile" but why down-vote this? It's fascinating. 
that was some amazing footage i just watched. AD Nidalee burst too stronk.

Obviously1 the caiman was sunbathing risking the chance of an instant death on either side.

Fantastic
My favorite fighter is the Tiger, they are so dominant in a fight but in a contest of hunting skill the Jaguar wins hands down amongst all hunters on earth excluding mankind. In a cage fight a Tiger can pulverize a Lion inside of a minute, a Jaguar however would last about 10 minutes at least maybe even win but the Tiger has the advantage in the cage. But set them loose in a closed jungle environment just the 2 of them... the Tiger will loose easily, inside of 30 seconds & won't see it coming!!
damn nature, you scary
Es la mascota de chuck norris!!

Wow. To see such a majestic animal attack so quickly and leathly an equally dangerous and strong animal like a ninja is awesome.
Reading this made me laugh so hard,everyone who played LOL i think will find it amusing.But then scrolling down the page,seeing all the social animals trying to copy it for a little attention reminded me half of us wouldn't survive very well outside of towns and cities.We watch an animal kill another ,( with football like commentary on background ) and find it cool, some find it repulsing.It's just LIFE.And we are disconnected from it.Don't trust my words, just read some comments below ;(

that jaguar would be no match if that was a t-rex
but why is it that the new is only posted on islamophob websites and why the fuck are you talking about religion on this video it has nothing to with religion you racist fuck 
The fact that jaguar was able to sneak up on that caiman was impressive enough but being able to bite through the caiman's tough skin and hit those vital areas with acute accuracy is very impressive indeed.
Reminds us of that other viral vid... Python Eats Alligator 02...

Lizard swimming shit
Jaguars in America and Tigers in Asia don't fear the water. So they usually hunt Crocos. In Africa, Lions and Leopards do, cause they can't hunt a Nile's Croco inside the water, although Lions are more aggresive than crocos out of it.
change the title . It's not a crocodile it's cayman. Jaguar would never be able to come even closer to crocodile.

isso n√£o √© um jaguar √© uma on√ßa pintada e isso n√£o √© um crocodilo e sim um jacar√© lol
Toi tes vraiment attard√© mon gars. Un crocodile (4,400 livre), un aligator (990 livre).Pour le Cayman (290 livre) Average. CRIS d'attard√© mental . Retourne dans ton h√¥pital.
Tener hambre es jodido.
Cause the animal knows that the videographers (wild life videographers are rarly alone in situations like that) know that he is there, so the % chance that he can eat the videographer is lower then the one of crocodile cause he dint notice the jaguar. Also add that the tactic that the jaguar used takes much less energy then running afther humans. and maybe cause the crocodile had more meat then the human(looks like a smal crocodile tho). i know,my english aint great. Like if DID read this XD 
yup it aims youtube
That literally aspires me to become a wild-life photographer.... in my dream off to bed! gn!

Ez hatalmas!
Black skin occurs among both jaguars and leopards, and it's a mutation. Like albino humans for example.
OMFG !!! 
black leopard are called Panther, but they are the same animal (Panthera pardus). My guess is a jaguar (Panthera onca) can also be black, but it will remain a jaguar.
quel est la difference entre un crocodile et un aligator.. yen a pas c'est cayman pareil haha!!
Haaahahaha the LoL's comments just made my day ! #TonsofDamages
This is not a crocodile. This is a caiman...
Jaguars are sometimes black. Even then they have spots. Leopards do not live in the Western Hemisphere.
well done for the jaguar

Muchas gracias por la explicaci√≥n y aclaraci√≥n. Gracias.
Looooool! Eeepiiiic!!!!
Me explicaron que el jaguar lo mat√≥. "Lo que pasa es que el video esta en ingl√©s, pero el narrador explica como despues de encajar los colmillos en el cuello del caim√°n desconecta su sistema nervioso central, llamalo suerte o como quieras, pero en esta ocaci√≥n, gan√≥ el jaguar."
From here you look like a kid and him an adult. He is simply exhibiting compassion and empathy. Your exhibiting the characteristics of bacteria growing on shit. You coward in your pajamas talking crap to kids from the worthless 2 cents of "knowledge" you scraped off of a bathroom stall wall. The internet gave you a chance to comment eh, gave you a chance to pretend your somebody. Your nothing, do humanity a favor and don't breed you useless spineless coward.

Branvo, PRO FUCKING HUNTER!
No se trata de que sea un Caim√°n o un cocodrilo, sino de la forma tan audaz como el Jaguar lo caza; se le par√≥ atr√°s, el lugar preciso para atrapar a esos lagartos. Los animales tienen un poder incre√≠ble para sobrevivir, pero el hombre tiene un mayor poder y es el de acabar con su propia existencia. 
What does religion has to do with this video? And anyway you are stupid as fuck.

es un caim√°n o un yacar√©, los cocodrilos no viven en am√©rica ..y el habitad de los jaguares es sud o centro am√©rica. ( los caimanes son bastante mas peque√±os que los cocodr√≠los).

Report Renekton for feeding.
La mordida de un felino grande como este puede acabar con su presa de 3 maneras. Una es simplemente asfixiando, la otra es punzando la vena yugu√±ar y la tercera (ocurre normalmente cuando muerde por detr√°s) es separando las primeras v√©rtebras paralizando a la presa (total o parcialmente tetrapl√©jica), lo cu√°l es aparentemente lo que sucedi√≥ si miras bien el video y te das cuenta que por un segundo se resisiti√≥, pero tras penetrar m√°s la mordida dej√≥ de moverse totalmente.

jaguars are bad asses
Vegans don't care about what the Jaguar wants to eat, they care about not eating the Jaguar & all other subordinate species out of existence or in cruel & inhuman ways like what some chicken & pig farmers do is brutal. (& I'm a chicken & pork lover but I despise what they do to kill my meat & would love to repay them the same way they treat my meat when it's still alive). & vegans also think it's a healthy lifestyle & until the top 1% stop putting profit before morality all power to the vegans.

The Jaguar doesn't have to build massive civilizations & systems of order & intelligence to survive humans do, totally different species have totally different ways of living life. But, i do get your point & I think humanity does place to much excessive value & trust in it's material pursuits & not enough on traits & abilities nature has already provided. The Jaguar is my favorite animal to admire because it's stealthy & underestimated, it's the only other feline to give a Tiger a good fight.

I accidently liked this video... But it's amazing... But i rather the animals be like in the eden haha
Damn thats awesome
the crocodile community doesnt like it 
ooooo... free viruses, how can i possibly resist
nh 
Tienes toda la raz√≥n, larga vida a ese jaguar! :)
Respect from the king of the forest :)
If it was an Australian salt water croc the little kitty would be dead in seconds
Lo que pasa es que el video esta en ingl√©s, pero el narrador explica como despues de encajar los colmillos en el cuello del caim√°n desconecta su sistema nervioso central, llamalo suerte o como quieras, pero en esta ocaci√≥n, gan√≥ el jaguar.
Vergaaaaaaaaaaaa
"boom, teeth in" made me dislike this video. So lame voice and vocabulary
some people work all day to get a piece of bread.The jaguar kills,and gets food for a month.
nobody gives a fuck - now move on please
That's was amazing
Vegans who apparently enjoy animal cruelty. You know since they want that jaguar to starve to death and all.
thumbs up if you came here because of OMAR ISUF
Absolutely amazing...
WAUW.. LOVE THIS ANIMAL!!
Apuesto a que el caim√°n le gan√≥ al jaguar, por eso no muestran el enfrentamiento completo. Ese caim√°n se ve grande y que logre coger al jaguar as√≠ sea de una mano se la arranca y pierde el Jaguar. Vendr√° la segunda parte? ......
lol
wow this jaguar made it looks so easy.
Fantastic! :D NationalGeograpic! :) Speak espanish? :/

too good !! jaguar and crocodile !

El jaguar toma al cocodrilo, lo lleva al r√≠o y le ense√±a a nadar? En qu√© termina esto? El caim√°n le pudo haber ganado al jaguar...
Vegans...
that is awesome!

So I looked this up:It does not say anything about harming women. It also says non-believers will be punished by Allah, and not by the people themselves. Finally marriage: it says it should not be rushed, for younger people are still busy growing up. Also suicide is disallowed (not related, but still, I wonder how those suicide terrorists expect to go to heaven?!). You should take a read yourself, it's actually quite interesting to see the similarities to Christianity.
es un Caiman, pariente del cocodrilo, estes es mas peque√±o y se encuentra en suramerica.
Yes they can, is not usal but they do so.

Go home jaguar! You're drunk.
What's wrong with u..there are no such things in Holy Qoran..have u read the Holy Qoran before..if not please read the Qoran first before making any statement that could offended others..Islam is good and beautiful religion and always ask people to do good to others..if a muslim does bad thing it is not Islam to blamed..it is person who not really learn and follow the religion properly and thoroughly..This is also happen in other religions like Christian, HIndu and Buddha..
Some people don't listen to him calling it a cayman

That is not related to the Koran or any kind of religion whatsoever.
nothing...everything!religion intrudes any area of life and the natural order of things in no exception and when a religious guy makes such a fucked up statement,thanI have to comment on it...simple as that
That's not actually in the koran. Get your facts straight. That societies or cultures decide to allow it does not mean it is in the koran.
Common misconception. They are related, but they are in fact a different species.
I think the jaguar miss of food for taking risk of attacking a caiman!! Poor beast!!
Caiman is also a crocodile, alligator or whatsoever it is crocodile 
What the fuck does this have to do with jaguars?
A caiman is barely a crocodile

I was about to write this, but u already covered that 
Apparently. Well, they're similar anyhow. It's just a misconception that a caiman IS a crocodile.
Hmmm. So a caiman is the same thing as a crocodile now?
Seriously ? Is there any way to watch popular videos without a fucking argument about God and stuff ? I am religious, I strongly believe in God [you don't care about my reasons, don't ask], yet I am getting REALLY tired about those. @GuardianVoroc, "religions are lying" is a very fast conclusion. History tends to prove that very fast conclusions only lead to bad things. Religions are way more complicated than that.
◊ë◊¢◊ú◊ô ◊î◊ó◊ô◊ô◊ù ◊û◊ú◊û◊ì◊ô◊ù ◊ê◊ï◊™◊†◊ï ◊õ◊ô ◊ë◊ó◊ô◊ô◊ù, ◊î◊°◊ë◊ú◊†◊ï◊™ ◊û◊©◊™◊ú◊û◊™.
Does it? I don't think any religious documents say that the sun revolves around the earth (feel free to prove me wrong on this, though.). And for all they know, heaven could be beyond the edge of the universe. I'm simply saying that there is a way for religions to adapt to science, even though you might not see how.
You are basically insulting his belief though :P
Ôªø
Does posting the same massage tons of times qualify as 'thinking'? If saying it one time doesn't cut it, saying it 50 times won't cut it either. I mean no disrespect to the actual message, though.

I don't understand your point. Sure, the U.S. are somewhat hypocritical. Every government is. But that's not related to my comment.

Did you know "Allah" and "God" literally translate to each other?
i'm fucking hate jewish.... the killer of muslims... then what? american hate iran so much cuz they have nuclear? so,USA dont have nuclear huh? Fucking retard country who like to WAR...
Alright, truth be told, you made me chuckle. Ever heard of google translate?
Citation needed. And reliable sources please, like proper statistics and official press. Not some back alley websites. I know well enough how culture differs over the planet. Stories from distant lands with, to us, nearly ununderstandable customs, get exaggerated a lot. Of course, bad things do happen, but they happen everywhere. They are not a fault of the religion, but of the people who decide to do those things.
It's quit interesting to see this war between Jaguar and Crocodile
so original joke :3
No, you may not blow the U.S
they dont understand...that's the fact...they're not muslims....they dont read quran,they dont want to face the TRUTH......
Jaguar wins! Fatality!!

As I told another person before, there are moderate muslims and extremist muslims. That a person is a muslim does not mean that he or she is an extremist. Other religions have the same thing going on, yet everyone presumes it's all muslims. Well, I guess that's life. I'm just lucky to be an atheist, I guess.

If your wording was actually comprehensible, I could probably give a good answer to that, but since it isn't, I'll just say that I do not wish to insult your religion, but that I simply personally have trouble understanding your method of spreading it.
Who has made it? Have you seen a design which hasn't a designer ?! Have you seen a wonderful,delicate work without a worker ?! It's you and the whole universe!.. Who has made them all ?!! You know who ?.. It's "ALLAH",prise be to him. Just think for a moment.
Where do you come from this erroneous idea that in our religion and commanded by the Prophet is (Fight in the cause of Allah those who fight you not transgress Allah loves not the aggressors)

Not entirely true. Those are extremists. There are also christian extremists, atheist extremists, jewish extremists, etc. . Do I hear you mention those? No? Then you shouldn't mention islamism specifically either.

No dumbass. Hes saying there is no need for commentary because he can see and hear what is happening. We dont need some guy to explain it too us. Maybe you are retarded.
Nature Laws has no Pitty
@losers talking about a religion that they dunno shit about and taking their asses off based on what they hear from their Jewish controlled media.. you ppl are doomed.. tsk tsk
If you are going to convince anyone of anything, by posting promotional messages to islamism every five seconds, it'll be that you are a pest and that islamism, if it is going to gain any followers via this method, needs a more subtle advertiser. Have a good day.

Exactly.
It's a caiman, not a cayman, and they're members of the crocodylia order and are as such crocodilians, sometimes generally called crocodiles. They're not, however, true crocodiles (i.e. members of the crocodylidae family of the crocodylia order). Don't be so nitpicky.

Jaguar attacks Crocodile. Amazing video. Must watch.Ôªø
if croc was aware of him he would have fucked him too :P 
bahaha I did it
so did the jaguar get his ass whooped in the water? because he needed to take the croc through the water where the croc is obvious much stronger?

Was this narrator bored to make this video?
the crocodile its f..kt :)) 
uhm, I think you're not aware of the fact that the cayman's kind of dead...
ok, but what will happen when the Jaguars crocodile will bring over water? the crocodile is stronger in the water! Therefore, I think the film breaks off, because Jaguars are later forced the crocodile to let go!

that's a pretty big croc man damn.. fucking jaguars are bad ass. just took it the fuck out like what bitch? oh you thought you were dominating this ecosystem? I don't think so mother fucker. It's croc-munchin' time.. that sounded a little too close to something else

this jaguar probably did this a thousand times... perfect execution... i wonder how it has such strength...

bloody Jaguar :@ 
You are King !!!
the fuck you talking about nigga, no one is interfering with anything
This is nature. The jaguar didn't kill the croc for the leather or the pleasure, but more likely for food, unlike us greedy humans.
It's the way of nature.. don't interfere with it.
WOW
so National Geographic channel crew is video taping this crap when crocodile been killed...Then why campign like save crocodile is done..I dont know....Is it viewing pleasure ?

Whatttttt??? Really! Nothing eats a croc, So I thought till I seen this clip.
do you understand the world Ecosystem ???
I believe that a 215 lbs jaguar would be able to fight a 360 lbs lion

the strongest cat all over the world. I believe that a 215lbs is able to fight a lion with 300 lbs jaguar
They exist on this planet to serve a purpose believe it or not but every bird, fish, insect, mammal contributes to our Eco-system and if a species were to be extinct it could cause a gap in the food chain causing ALOT of problems that are almost impossible to predict, Unbalance of nature, Disease, the list goes on. Very ignorant comment you obviously didn't think at all.
full video pls...
You should be heavily sedated. 
Am I the only one that thinks this guy sounds like hes doing golf commentary? 
Because honestly, we as a species do not have any right to choose which species we want to keep around unless it's directly causing massive damage to us as a whole. Besides, jaguars only kill like 2 people a year. That doesn't merit going "Fuck it, let them die".
beatifull jaguar... 
"People" like you shouldn't have the right to interact with living beings. You should be in a cage.
I want to be a jaguar now...
beautiful nature
Esta pelea no estuvo arreglada!!!!!
not a bad but also not a good 
Great! Like!

yea fuck squirrels right?
Y de pronto un comentario en espa√±ol...
Need?? You mean you dont need wild animals to play call of duty or watch x factor or buy useless shit you dont need?? No, you dont need wild animals to live your shallow life, but most of us with a brain and a sense of morality do not want to see such beautiful animals go extinct.

Now that's how you hunt, killer Jaguar hehe. They are very magnificent creatures =) Protect them is say!! P.s and they have very VERY cute kittens ^^
This is what it looked like when I was fucking your mom!
FULL video pls!! D:!!!
...right, so we should not care about any of the big cats, sharks, crocodiles, alligators, komodo dragons, bears, wolfs, venomous snakes. scorpions spiders. what about other animals that kill humans for reasons other than food like elephants, hippos, rhinos, apes, gorillas. A lot of the animals i've names are endangered. Not going to have many animals left if everyone had your ignorant way of thinking.
mischhhh se la hizo corta....jajajajajajaja

You are therefore warned now before it gets too late for you. Jesus Christ is holy.He loves your soul, and wants to save you, that's the reason you are receiving this gospel. 
You have only one life on earth, after it the judgement of God follows..Repent of your sinful lifestyle, accept Jesus Christ into your life now...failure to do so and you die...Hell fire in torment forever. If you are into masturbation, fornication, adultery, prostitution (private or public), patronizing prostitutes, abortion, lesbianism, homosexualism, watching pornography (I Corinthians 6:9-10), or any form of immorality, you need to repent. watch,'chosentv' online 
just Leopards, the lions never will ;)
 Almighty God, use the blood of Jesus to wash my sins away. Lord Jesus, come into my heart, be my Lord and personal Savior. I surrender my life to you. Cancel my name from the book of death and write it in the book of life. Give me power to sin no more. In Jesus name I pray. Amen!! 'THE LORD'S CHOSEN CHARISMATIC REVIVAL MOVEMENT'. Watch chosentv.org, thelordschosenworld, and chosennews online. 1John 1:9 If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us 
If you have decided now to give your life to Jesus Christ and to forsake your sinful lifestyle, you need to pray this prayer: Almighty God, I come unto you in the name of Jesus. Father I confess that I am a sinner. All my sins I confess to you. I am very sorry for all my sins (mention those you can remember). Lord I promise you that from today I will never continue in them anymore. I believe that Jesus Christ died and rose again on the third day for my justification. 
I see this has many likes, but i had to dislike cos it's been done to death!!
If you must be a blessed child of God,you must repent of your sins and give your life to Jesus Christ.If you believe Jesus Christ today,righteousness of God will come into your life and abundant life will be your portion.If you neglect this call to repentance and salvation,you will not escape hell fire(Hebrews 2:3).In Luke 13:3, Jesus said, ‚ÄòI tell you,Nay:but except ye repent,ye shall all likewise perish‚Äô.Read Matthew 6:33
Perhaps you wear trousers as a woman? (Read Deuteronomy 22:5), that is an abomination (Revelation 21:8, 27). Therefore, make up your mind, repent and give your life to Jesus Christ.Are you spoilt? Jeremiah 4:30 says, ‚Äò‚ÄòAnd when thou art spoiled, what wilt thou do? Though thou clothest thyself with crimson, though thou deckest thee with ornaments of gold, though thou rentest thy face with painting, in vain shalt thou make thyself fair; thy lovers will despise thee. They will seek thy life‚Äô‚Äô
Are you into marry and divorce? Then you are sinner. Are you married to more than one person? Repent!! Marriage is between a man and a woman. Marriage is for better and for worse until death separates (Matthew 19:3-6). ‚ÄòWherefore they are no more two but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together let no man put asunder (separate)‚Äô. Cheating on your wife or husband is sin. Proverbs 28: 13 says, ‚Äò‚ÄòHe that covers his sins shall not prosper...You must repent of them, confess and forsake them.
grandioso, esto es grandioso, muerte a los reptilianos.

If we see a cockroaches, rats and/or mosquito, we will not only attack and kill them and much more. So y do we save another people when they are dying in a car accident or in a hospital? Oh wait. sorry i forgot. Its becoz we r human and we r the only one deserved saving :)

I could never kill an animal unless it was self defence, but honestly, who cares if it is endangered,if a Jaguar sees a human it will attack, why should we save them.

I wish Jaguars weren't an endangered species, damn poachers.

fed rengar jumping on renekton. poor renekton
i would rather say "impressive" 
noluyor hamƒ±na goyiiimm
True stealth. Impressive fast kill. Right in the brain case. So cool.
The cool thing about this is that the jaguar *knew* it was goint to win. It didn't see the croc as a dangerous adversary... it only saw it as dinner! (fuck off reptiles! Mammals rule the earth now! :-P )

He pronounces it jag warr because that is how it is pronounced in the USA and in Canada. Where are you from? Different areas of the world pronounce things differently even in the same language or have you never noticed the difference between American, British and Australian English dialects?
League of Legends players are gonna rock this world
The title should say: ''Rengar ganks Renekton''
NO BODY WANTS TO HEAR THAT SHIT and if they do they will let you or other people like you know, so shut up
Badass

Do some research look into mohammed and aiisha as well she was his FAVOURITE WIFE. Think about everything we have the life God Gave us God Obviously Loves us very much now why would he want you to kill anyone isnt that just a counterproductive irrational creator why create people in the first place. Muslims I know you Will hate this post but you need to cry out to Jesus He is the only way to the FATHER Read john 14:6

Real?Ôªø
just to let you know, caimans don't get very big. Depending on the species that one probably was full grown. It looked like a spectacled caiman to me. 
I disagree. Wild cats are much more agile and stealthy than given credit for. Crocs are stealthy however have few predators so are not as evolved to protect against them.
No allah is not just another word for god. The Muslim origin of allah comes from the moon god allah who was adopted and turned into an all encompassing god by mohammed. History preoves that before islam was created the sabeans in arabia worshipped the moon- god who was married to the sun god. they gave irth to 3 godesses that were called al-lat, al-uzza and manat they became idols and were worshipped throughout that part of the world as the "daughters of allah" Crescent moon is moon gods symbol
you're an idiot.
Always ward river.
karthus take R please

How ill are you to comment that on this video? xD (no offense, im just joking) 
remember kids do not try this at home, also kats do not like water so do not trow your cat in the water so it can hunt ducks.. just saying ;)

Holy crap
nope
Impresionante el Jaguar, pero creo que es forzado a hacer eso, por alimentarse ya que la explotaci√≥n humana a exterminado su alimento b√°sico, aunque parezca impresionante la realidad da pena lo que el humano ocasiona al medio ambiente que el jaguar arriesgue su vida por una presa as√≠, haber si un humano tenga la necesidad de cazar un le√≥n con sus propias manos haber como le va, espero que le pase alg√∫n d√≠a para que aprenda de una vez por todas

Its not a crocodile, its a caiman, he even says it in the video so why is the title wrong? is it to get more views? a caiman is much smaller and alot weaker than a real crocodile
The skull had been broken, there's no way the croc can fight back.
How do they film this, where are they standing

If you don't want to get ganked you need to place wards.

allez vous faire rien 
I just wondered the same thing, I showed my wife this and she thought it was amazing and awesome. If it was a video of the jaguar being attacked, I wouldn't have even shown her! We can relate to mammals more than reptiles, but big cats even more so, hence the low 'shock value' of this sort of attack. I'd just like to know if the jaguar swam back to shore with the croc in his mouth!
that was fucking beautiful..
that was fucking beautiful..
NATUREEE, YOU ARE DOING IT WRONG
Zagryz≈Ç go, czy nie?
Report Renekton, AFK
So good league of legende :'))))
I for one do not feel sorry for the reptile. I have over twenty pet reptiles, so saying that I like my cold blooded friends would be an understatement. However, you have to understand that this is nature. That is just how the food chain works and reptile owners especially *should* understand that.

I can't be the only one out there that would feel sad if it were the other way around. Are some of us innately drawn to cats > reptiles? Are there people out there that feel sorry for the reptile? I am genuinely curious of this. 
Gank style, no wards!

THAT GANK! 
Multiple elements of my mind war over videos like these. I'm at once fascinated and impressed with the leopard (and so nature), and sad that one of the key selective pressures in evolution is the inexhaustible drama of predator and prey.Ôªø
Nidallee and renekton the fight! ;)
yes the crocodli no move after 1 nidalee W so that damage would be OP... dont act like smart kid
Newfound respect for jaguars right there.
jaguar's and panthers are the scariest of all predators that you can run into...I would MUCH rather run into a lion or tiger.
Yes, nid is a better jungler :P
So because it's moving, is it fake??
The hunter becomes the hunted... 
Wow I didn't know that lol
kill that croc !!! 
Ganked.
You can see it's fake cus the korkodilos dont move after attack!
Cool
LOL dammit i was trying to take a break from lol...
that was in the main page of Youtube.

Islam is a false religion that many evil people follow and use as an excuse for their evil behavior. Do you have a real relationship with god? No you don't, you just have to try and believe its true because you have no spiritual connection to god at all.

*~ Jaguar Attacks Caiman ~**When a jaguar pounces, sometimes one bite is all it takes to get a meal. National Geographic has exclusive video of a jaguar taking down a caiman in Brazil's Pantanal wetlands, photos of which went viral earlier this month. Luke Dollar, a conservation scientist who helps manage National Geographic's Big Cats Initiative, explains the hunt and explosive moment of predation.*Read the article from National Geographic News:http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/09/130925-caiman-jaguar-animals-science-video-brazil-attack/VIDEOGRAPHERS: Kedar Hippalgaonkar and Parul JainNARRATOR: Luke DollarEDITOR: Will HalicksSPECIAL THANKS: Jason KurtisRESEARCH: Joe Lemeris#Jaguar   #Caiman   #Wildlife   #Nature   #Photography   #AmazonJungle   #Brazil   #Predator   #BigCats  Ôªø

Oh ich wusste net dass ein jaguar n'krokodil besiegen kann gei l!!!!! Oh i don't know that a jaguar a crocodil kann kill awsome!!
massa de mais
...part II? ...you know the eating of the croc!!!!
That is a strong animal, i wonder what is it's jaw P.S.I
Lets not be arrogant here. We all have our beliefs and there really is no point in arguing with ones opinion, we all have our own opinions on many different things and we choose whether we change them or not. 
i agree with you 
er...that was not a good ending, you should show us how jaguar eats a croc too
that would be beastility! 
It nature, how else will carnivores and/or herbivore eat if not by killing? The only reason we choose what we eat is because God gave us the beautiful gift of having a powerful mind much more capable than any other animal on this earth. Use your mind and think because these animals have no other way of choosing what they eat and what they don't eat. They don't have the capabilities to think reasonably about barbaric things. Its nature and like it or not, God created these creature as well.
Finally, a croc gets it. Always wanted to see some creature give it to the croc after all the croc doing it to the other animals! Jag the man!!
the blue day of... 
seriously fuck off how the fuck is this barbaric its nature ffs some animal NEED to eat other animals to survive its part of the food chain and the food chain is a delicate thing if you completely remove carnivores and other violent animals you will have a complete collapse of the entire food chain and EVERYTHING will DIE.... dumbass 
damm JAGUAR you scary
SERIAL RAPIST JAGUAR...damn. Lol, the Ted Bundy of The Animal Kingdom!!!!
nice attack!
Muhammed? Peace? Bwhahahaha!! Good One!! XD
Kindly not bring racist issue here, if you not know the whole story, dont judge other religion. Study about muhammad from the true source. hopely we will bring peace among our world.
:(
I wouldn't fuck with a jaguar
LOL. the entire ecosystem would collapse the carnivores would all die first herbivores would over populate immensely and strip the landscape bare of vegetation which in turn would cause everything else to die.. in fact what your proposing is an apocalypse... 
Except the fact that animals eating animals is a HUGE part of earth's animals cycle. Also who is this "god" you speak of?
–ê–∑—É–µ—Ç—å!
1 Timothy 4:1-5 comes to mind too.
Damn !!
Brazil is a country rich in wildlife if it had more television crews interested in filming here, have several beautiful images like this, even I've seen numerous interesting pictures like this ... # ficadica ..
I want to make a Renekton versus nidalee joke so bad here...
Wow!
Came here from UFC knockouts lol seems accurate...
Jaguar warrior! The best!
Wow! Screw with Honda, Nissan, Lexus, BMW, Infinite, Audi and Porsche...I could Buy Jaguar car!
Muhammad had sex with a 9 year old.
I'd be a viggie myself.... if it wasnt for the fact that meat is so fucking healthy and tasty..... 
Damn nature you scary!!!!!
You die, decompose, become soil, where plants will end up eating you. Also all these animals would eat you if they had the chance. Better eat them before they eat you.

If it was an australian croc that jag would be dead.
Didn't by that logic mean that God created the jaguar and his instincts to kill? It's his nature.

He is just eating to survive, not to cause pain on the other animal. We as humans have really overdone killing sadly.Once we killed just to eat also there is nothing wrong with that.
eventually his body will get eaten by worms when he will die.
El jaguar s√∫per bien alimentado con carne blanca!

whats wrong with you kids...do you need to prove how cool you by swearing at people for no reason whatso ever, grow up and at least show us your age so we dont have to think your mommy had to opene your youtube account for you
Yeah, lets just go to the Jaguar and ask him "Hey there big guy, think you could not eat the nice caiman, and maybe grab a salad instead?" 
go jaguar its ya borthday
que culiao el jaguar..jaja es un capo..
I'm surprised no lawyer has stepped up to defend the rights of the late mr. caiman. Of course since mr. caiman is no longer around he'll obviously has to charge the government for his fee's because everyone is entitled to representation. And before you go on dismissing this as stupid; these stupidities are going on right now. In almost every government.
Its people like you who should be eaten. Go read about ecosystems or something. Make an educated comment.

Why, because you say so? You think nature is wrong and you and your feelings are right? That's nature, there are predators and prey, circle of life my friend. You should get out more and see the real world and not be pampered with your iPhone, luxury car, and whatever else. If you were in the wold and starving I bet anything you would kill an animal to survive rather than think "I cant eat him, I wont be able to sleep at night! oh, no!"
nobody cares about you're opinion, you're a fucking idiot
*Jaguar Attacks Crocodile*Ôªø
agreed - but lets assume that the jaguar is PIMP!
Check out this sly killer I witnessed struggle as she/preying mantis attacks the wrong prey. wont let me post a link, so visit my page for it! 
You don¬¥t live Amozonas(Brazil),because there are crocodiles. So.... STUDY!!!!!!!! 
Hooo Cmon , if you think like this , Why in the blue hell you clicked the Clip ???? and BTW , this is the circle of life , and the way you think you will get eated by someone like me . 
Nah
Though I agree with you about the fact that they are caimans, there ARE species of crocodile in the Americas. Look up American Crocodile if you have the time. 
Nice!
Caimans = alligator =)

Isn't the jaguar pretty much an african couger? kind of like the panther?
omg!!!! 
Fed mid lane nidalee ganks renekton through the river. He didn't even see it coming, should have warded.
hahaha
isn't a cocrodile, it's just a caiman. A little bit small.
i found this very disturbing
If National geographic wants to be taken seriously and respect the accurate narration of the researcher change the title to jaguar attacks caiman! FFS there are no crocodiles in America, only caimans and alligators! 
o_O

Me arruino la infancia .-. HAAHAHAH ok no :C 
yeah but imagine if the jaguar wasn't a wussy and faced the croc head on
He must have filmed it but it was either boring or something unfortunate happened
Willyrex aprueba este v√≠deo.
It's much easier than you might expect. Crocodiles have a weakness on the neck where the spinal cord go into the head. A single cut (or bite) there and the crocodile dies almost instantly. You can see in the video that the jaguar knows what hes doing because hes rushing directly there and it's all over with one bite.
el jaguar manda !!!
WHAT!?I thought that caiman are stronger the Jaguars.
I bet you play call of duty to...
Thats one badass Pussy !
ÿµÿßÿ∑Ÿä ÿßŸÑŸàÿµÿÆ

Haha. Lol. 
thanks
Well it's the caiman's fault for not seeing the jaguar coming his way
We just had a new baby Jaguar born here in the Jacksonville Zoo. So Yes, they are roaming and breeding here. (Google it) Feel stupid now?
That's a little bit of a cheat, the title said Crocodile not Caiman, that's like alligator sized. 
Don¬¥t miss the newww advances about DBZ: HERE /watch?v=_jYSYkpA-WM
what a g LOL
dayum that crocodile got messed up.
That was such a clean and brutal kill! Damn, feel kinda sorry for the Caimen though :( Poor thing didn't even have a chance to fight
Very Interesting
*That funny line from Family Guy*...
i actually enjoyed listening to him
damn how powerful are jaguar' to be able to bite through crocodile skin?
el Yaguarete es el tigre sudamaricano, es una de los m√°ximo depredadores de Am√©rica despu√©s del oso. si el cocodrilo estuviera por agua el cocodrilo gana, porque es muy r√°pido en el agua, ataca como un torpedo, pero si esta en tierra, el cocodrilo es lento y torpe como una tortuga marina en la playa. y en tierra el cocodrilo esta pr√°cticamente indefenso 
I didn't know they ate crocs, you learn something new every day.
omg!
AWESOME
the jaguar looks kinda fake but that jaguar is a beast literally 
Cheeta vs Killer croc

No lo creo... no se animar√≠a a atacar al jaguar, adem√°s hay casos de leones por ejemplo comi√©ndose cocodrilos, el jaguar no es mucho m√°s peque√±o que el le√≥n
Nature bitches.
Perfect timing. Perfect bite.
Well for once I got what I came for on youtube
wahou
Se rif√≥. 
Genial :-)
he made it look so easy
Great educational video on the power of cats as apex predators. But why did you cut it off so early? Would have been interesting to see that cat swim, drag and eat a prey near or heavier then itself.
Damn nature!! You scary!
subanlo full, no omitan las partas en las que el caiman agoniza
like a boss. 
Now that's what I call a surgical kill. Well done!
Damn coming from water onto land like that; Fucking SEAL right there.

ES UN YAGUARETE YA QUE EN AMERICA NO HAY COCODRILOS TAMBIEN HAY CAIMANES QUE SON MUCHO MAS GRANDES PERO ES ASOMBROSA LA FUERZA DE ESTE JAGUARETE PARA SOMETRE SEMEJANTE PIEZA
"Jaguar Attacks Crocodile" is the name of the vid, "Jaguar commentary and then Jaguar Attacks Crocodile" is what this vid should've been called.
Beautiful animal
Same like USA attack on oil.
1:42 OH SHIT TIME TO RUN!
Its not crocodile; its a caiman....Los cocodrilos estan en Africa; este es un caiman chiquito; si fuera un cocodrilo la presa hubiera sido el jaguar....
that's a killing machine !

That was freakin AWESOME... good work catching that NAT GEO I would have believed that Caiman hunt stupid Jaguars not the other way around. Did you see how sneaky that Jaguar was? Man those Jaguars must have some crazy bites to stop a Caiman that fast.

Jaguars are ruthless, unlike most big cats they go for the skull rather than the neck, literally crushing the skull of the prey. Damn nature. 
Easy
Not in the UK.
NIDALEE VS RENEKTON !!!!!!!!! 
Wow amazing
I don't know about Portuguese and Spanish common names, but in English this cat is a jaguar. The black jaguar is the same species, just different colour.
waaOOO.. 
Your name is the caiman. Your urge to pun is the jaguar.

on√ßa e jacar√© 
sabido es que los otorongos (como se les llama en esta parte de Sud-America ) atacan anacondas, caimanes y los matan atravesando sus craneos es el mayor depredador de las selvas americanas y el tercer felino en tama√±o en el mundo despu√©s del tigre y el leon.

... y se veia tan tierno, que fuerza de ese jaguar ! 
increible 
In Brazil this cat, is called "On√ßa" and don't Jaguar. Jaguar it's Black Cat Live in Argentina
Esse tipo de situa√ß√£o √© normal no Pantanal, mas √© preciso lembrar que a ca√ßa predat√≥ria ao Jacar√© pelo seu coro acabou gra√ßas aos criadouros como o da Fazenda Caimam e outros, mas a coitada da on√ßa pintada ainda √© alvo de ataques dos fazendeiros, e √© um animal em perigo de extin√ß√£o. ent√£o essa cena pode estar com seus dias contados!

Yes, the jaguar here is actually attacking a caiman, a small type of crocodile. The title of this video is a bit misleading. If National Geographic had been fully honest & accurate, entitling it "Jaguar Attacks Caiman", do you think this video would have ever gone viral the way it has? Of course not. And if YOU were uploading a video, knowing that just one slightly distorted term in the title would make all the difference between it going viral or not, would you do the distortion? Of course. 
WOOOWWWWW ASOMBROSO 
Go cats

that's an assassin
Chip Chocolate is the best rapper EVER!! Cookie Dance!!!
semantics
La primera vez que veo algo asi Impresionantes bestias.
what final?
Dice, mas o menos... "Aqui se ve un Jaguar, un macho, bastante grande, buscando presas en la orilla del rio, en su habitat hay como 85 diferentes especies de animales que son parte de su dieta. Aqui se ve asechando un caiman, con mirada fija como laser y boom, directo a la cabeza o por lo menos desconecto el sistema nervioso central porque ese caiman ya no pelea. Ahora se lo llevara para comerselo a su conveniencia" o algo asi =p
Epic!
I'd be scared sh!tless if I was that Caimen
I mean POOP
more species have been exticnt than are alive right now, it seems the purpose of earth is to die. those animals you love that are carnivores would eat you in a second if they were hungry. and dont forget about plants, you are a killer when you eat plants just as much as killing animals for food.
finally a new video
noce speak both English, excellent video, never in my life I have to say, I saw I could not believe that a Jaguar, Tiger, or hunt a Caiman crocodile.
ima a jaguar ROAH POP SHIT RUN

Awesome video - Jaguar Attacks Crocodile (EXCLUSIVE VIDEO)Ôªø
what ever happened to thos british commentators.. this nerds voice just doesnt cut it
wow, never seen anything quite like that before. that was awesome. I love the big cats!
accion in 1:30
Lol, te jaguar is very intelligent and strong
no a caiman is a crocodilian and belongs to the alligator part of the family. holy fuck use the awesome internet at your fingertips and learn.
Aprende Steve Irwin!!! desde el cielo...
ITS A RALIGATOR 
What happened next? How did he get it across the water?
Its not a croc.
Amazing video.
no, jaguars are from americas, leopards are from africa and asia
Es un yaguarete
Awebo el mexicano cagando el video de extranjeros
rengar?? wtf 
rengar?? wtf 
did the jaguar died
This'd be a lot more awesome if the guy was Australian. The accent in the narration just makes any wildlife video 100 X better.
no 
That's why caiman don't live with crocs cause they will be food!!!
sick!! 
nidalee new counter to renekton
Awesome.
The way he picked up that croc is so badass
Dude get your facts right they are kind to the alligator much smaller!!!
this is not supposed to be a "gringo" though, this is supposed to be nature experts from an organization devoted to nature and they fuck up the title like this. they must be hard up for views because misleading people like this only works on americans.
He caiman, he saw, and he conquered. 
Wards Are essential Renek, ffs too pushed.
Me hubiera gustado haber entendido al menos lo que dec√≠a el relatador :_
oh and my reseach took 3 seconds to confirm on multiple sites.
No es un jaguar es un leopardo!
Y que mierdas si es o no un cocodrilo, es muy fuerte el jaguar .l.
go check it out stupid instead of saying what you think i do or do not know. go fucking learn instead of parroting. caimans are alligators, gators and crocodiles are both part of the crocodilian branch. calling a caiman a croc is like calling a rattlesnake a boa constrictor. different types of the same family.
Jaguar contra cocodriloÔªø
Nidalee vs Renekton
que perfei√ßao de ataqua! 
klack or get klacked
jaguars can easily take prey bigger than them and carry prey more than their body weight, this is not amazing and happens on an hourly basis all over the americas and africa and anywhere else jags hunt.
for gringos, a caiman or a crocodile are the same shƒØt.
So you wonder what NG would do if a jaguar was stalking a child. Would its photographers do the scientific thing and let nature run its course or intervene?
wow nice rengar gank, really caught that renekton pushed up
attacks crocodile*....LOL lets see that cat take on a salty and see what happens....
F*ck! I am scared of Crocodile, now you eat what I am scared at?!
its not a crocodile though
humans ARE nature.
GG, report Renekton for feeding nidalee
but it IS fake, since its not a crocodile. it is a caiman.
Uff impresionante
not as scary as humans...
Awesome creature jaguar, sad for the croc tho.
ES UNA COMPLETA BARSOF√çA, NO ES UN COCODRILO, ES UN CAIM√ÅN BEBE, DE LA FAMILIA DE LOS COCODRILOS ES VERDAD, LOS COCODRILOS SON MUCHO M√ÅS GRANDES, NO TIENEN LA COLA TAN LARGA, LOS CAIMANES S√ç. LOS COCODRILOS TIENEN SU MANDIBULA MUCHO M√ÅS PRONUNCIADA, LOS CAIMANES LA TIENEN MUCHO M√ÅS CORTA .UN JAGUAR SER√çA INCAPAZ DE ATACAR A UN COCODRILO X QUE ESTE LO SUPERA EN TAMA√ëO Y PESO UN COCODRILO ADULTO PUEDE LLEGAR A PESAR M√ÅS DE 100KGRS, Y UN JAGUAR A LO MUCHO PODR√çA LLEGAR A 40 KGRS, 
they ARE alligators, however gators and crocodiles are both crocodilians. it is a major fail for NG to be mislabelling this video. from wiki,,,Characteristics Crocodiles are similar to alligators and caimans; for their common characteristics and differences between them, see Crocodilia. 
Nidalee wins ;D
GJ nidalee
Dying by Nidalee, after all...
Britney Spears - work bitch (best song ever!!! buy at itunes 
wtf lol thats not even what im talking about
you did not do your research... this guy would know 200x more than you ever will. while he probably went to school and you didnt.

No ma chingon el pinche jaguar se rifo00
You would hope that a humans superior intelligence either keeps him well away from danger and able to escape at a moments notice, or lets him build and use weapons and technology to aid him. After-all our defining quality is our superior brains, right? We dont have the eyes of a hawk, the reflexes of a big cat or the strength of a bull. BRAINPOWER!
Looks like a fight against me and a thanksgiving dinner
yeah he fed rengar, lol.
Guess this means that the jaguars food source is lowering so they're having to find new prey
Cool!
Cool!
Where I know, Caiman are not crocodile, they are more like alligators. In Brazil there is no crocodiles! Just "jacar√©s". The video is really nice!!! Congrats! 
guns.
Whoa.
Eres incre√≠ble troy :):)
as for you dumbass national geographic poster. caimans are NOT crocodiles, they are gators, this is common knowledge, how can you claim to be educational when your hosts dont even label things correctly.
awesomeÔªø
Ahah, dude, I laughted so much... =D
shut your stupid fucking mouth and learn before you show the rest of the world your ignorance some more, now learn...The term is sometimes used even more loosely to include all extant members of the order Crocodilia: which includes all members of Crocodylidae, including the tomistoma, the alligators and caimans (family Alligatoridae) and the gharials (family Gavialidae), and the rest of Crocodylomorpha, which includes all of the prehistoric crocodile relatives and ancestors.
lmfao pathetic piece of shit
OP nid 
Wow
what cinema can do and special effects.... this video is false.... do not believe everything they show you ... natgeo is Illuminati, i think
Did you see the size of that fucken Caiman..Ya may be a wrong tittle but doesn't take away from the awesome Jaguar..
finally! Real National Geographic video!

So its ok if a jaguar kills a crocodile, but its not ok if a hawk kills a bunny? #Logic #Thisisnottwitter
The guy said: "center Brazil"... it's north Brazil, in center Brazil you have cities like Rio De Janeiro, S√£o Paulo and others...

this is on√ßa pintada not jaguar
I' ve alway said that Renekton doesn't stand a chance against her.
Sobre todo porque es un caim√°n.....
thats awesome ! Jaguars truely are the master of beasts 
Orange panda stfu the difference between a bunny and croc is the croc will fucking mutilate your ass jaguar 1 croc 0
Lol what?? What the fuck are you talking about? a hawk killing a baby bunny, and a jaguar killing a crocodile, whats the difference apart from different animals?
Qu√©, bobito, no le prestan atenci√≥n en su casa y tiene que venir aqu√≠ a llamar la atenci√≥n, para sentirse menos miserable? Busque ayuda en lugar de buscar discusiones absurdas son gente que no conoce.
badass jaguar.. bon appetit
Great take down, flawless in fact 
Big cats are dangerous.
The power of burst Nidalee, not even Renekton can stand against her..
Wow. That's scary.
espectacular :)
Very nice
I never saw the wabbit die, just as I won't see orangepanda die. Difference is, an animal dying will still be a shame.
ajjaja ni hablar deci que el cayman no jiro si no lo hacia mierdaa
wow 
Great cat .. hem has hambre of caymans 
no...no it's not
Espetacular !
Es impresionante, tuvo valor para atacar a un cocodrilo :O
damn nature you scary!
what happen to the caiman?!!! 
Yeah there is. Thats like saying there's no difference between a theif and a murderer
Ban nidalee 
amader funk 
Crocodile gets fucked up, no one cares.. Baby bunny dies, "awww THATS ANIMAL ABUSE" "IM SO FUCKING DEPRESSED" they're both fucking animals, just we humans preceive the bunny to be "cute" but in reality theres no fucking difference from a crocodile dying and a bunny dying.

Renekton killed by nidalee
OMG RENEKTON STOP FEED NIDALEE !!
 Incroyable de voir un Jaguar nager et chasser dans son environnement et quel chasseur en plus, 1 croco de 2m attraper en plein cerveaux Magnifique Survivant. Je savez pas que c'√©tait possible.. Jaguar Panthere Leopard Rare is Beautifull Predator of Jungle
Wow that is not something you see every day
yeah they do, caiman crocodiles, the guy said it in the video.
Fucking nidalee OP!!!
one two .....bang 
The moral of this story is...don't fuck...with a jaguar
Strange that a croc didn't get the jaguar as he swam in the water.
wat
Le pico los ojos que profesional
Chesteer Cheetos :D !!!
caiman, not a croc
they don't usually eat other predators because they're much harder to get 
On√ßa Pintada Vs Jacar√©...Don't have Crocs in Brazil...
Jaguar Vs Caiman Yacare (Yaguarete Vs Yacare) Jaguar Wins Flawless Victory!
Toxic from eating meat? Don't be ridiculous. Predators often avoid each other simply because they risk getting injured by fighting another predator and a serious injury in the wild equals death.
This is imposeple
dont have man,have jacar√© its little than crocs.
that¬¥s bullshit. eating some meat that allready has the calories and vitamins youu need its actually more apropiate and convenient

Yes, in Brazil there are crocs, in Pantanal, Amazonia, and others places too.

That's not a Croc instead that's a Caiman. Besides American crocs are not as larger as their old world counter parts so it's not gonna be that hard to take one down. Lions, and Tigers do it why can't the Jaguar?

The other caiman is like wtf i gotta get outta here 
Rengar ganked renekton
GG no RE 
Jaguars are not afraid of anything... More cautious then afraid... And are said to have the more powerful bite of all the big cat family...
Renekton just got a gank.
*CAIMAN *CROCODILE
Hey plz check out my music video ;)
Holly fuck,the Jaguar actually behaved almost like a caimon/crocodile etc in the water!! Tell me about Karma lol
nice killÔªø
Its an alligator, not a crocodile. That cat would stand no chance against a full sized salt water crocodile. And being in the water, would not be a good idea in crocodile territory, much less aligator territory.
This Cat could eat you ;)
Nidalee=OP
wow just wow!
:O
Hunting like a baaus
Lol
ON√áA vs JACAR√â = POSITIVE...........JAGUAR vs CROCODILO = NEGATIVE
in 2 days 5 million wiews??? omg!
Great footage but it's like they got a sports commentator. "One, two, boom!" What the hell is that all about?
caman is not a crocadile
Renekton feed Rengar, GL.
thats why nida counters renekton
Even in Portuguese sources it says Onca and Jaguar are the same animal. Synonyms.

Maybe he didn't fuck with the Jaguar, maybe he was just hungry. So that makes him even more Lethal
renekton is feeding nida

WOW, one of the most interesting and amazing when you think thing. People have to use various of techniques they invent and powerful weapons to avoid crocodiles and other dangerous animals and jaguar just using his instincts and teeth. Bravo, Nature, respect for you.
No ward :/ 
ONCA PINTADA !

...and even for the animal "ounce" in english is associated with snow leopard "panthera uncia". The "on√ßa-pintada" in english is jaguar or "panthera onca".
cameraman should better watch his back
Pensando en la cena....Wow!"Cuando un jaguar salta, un bocado es todo lo que  necesita para conseguir una comida. Ahora en Youtube el v√≠deo de un jaguar derribando a un caim√°n en el Pantanal de Brasil, del cual se difundieron fotos a principios de este mes. D√≥lar de Lucas, cient√≠fico de la conservaci√≥n que ayuda en Iniciativa Cats Big director del National Geographic, explica la caza y el momento explosivo de la depredaci√≥n."Ôªø

Feeding nida... Not good idea ! 
Yup, here in Brazil we call it On√ßa-Pintada
Don't mess with a jaguar!Ôªø
It's not jaguar, it's "ON√áA".
Yes they are related, that is not the same as being the same spices. Crocs, Gators, Caiman & Gharials are all the same Order, Caiman & Gators are the same family, but again not the same spices. Hence "(Related yes) It is like saying a peregrine falcon and a dove are the same thing because they are birds.
that was insanely awesome
Wow!!
why didnt the camera guy zoom in a bit -__- 
wow thats a nice pet 
while America is a continent with many languages in it your still supposed to speak write read English not judging just saying English is the native language and you should stick to it I mean if I go Japan then ima learn some Japanese an so forth
Wow
That's A Bad Ass Jaguar 4 Real Son!!
This animal is ON√áA. In english speak ON SAH. The crocodile is JACAR√â speak JAH KAH - REH 
Nidalee two shot renekton best counter ever 
 Y portugues :D 
incorrect, america is not a continent, "NORTH AMERICA" is a continent, Canada and America(USA) share said continent.
Is it normal that at the beginning after watching the jaguar get out of water i started thinkinh a jaguar is more dangerous than a lion???
You call that a gecko ? A you stupid ????
Epic !
bullshit he never ate the croc that's why they stopped the video because the croc got away you can fool these motherfuckers below me but not me
Change the fucking misleading title, caiman not crocodile bitchhhhh

Approximately 10 million individual Yacare Caiman exist within the Brazilian Pantanal, representing what is quite possibly the largest single crocodilian population on Earth.

Did not feed that much versus Jax yesterday :s
Renekton stop feed nidalee please D': 
Horrible. All predators should become vegans. Don't they know it's healthier for them?
Perd√≥n? Crees que Am√©rica es Estados Unidos?

Haven't crocodile in Brazil! This is one alligator.
Meanwhile, my dog is scared of the vacuum cleaner.
You know...there are people with crocodiles as pets.
Buen√≠simo... 
nida OP .... 
Wy do people thumb down nature vids. Peta faggs
Use google translate you dumb fuck! also, you tube can be seen almost worldwide so that makes it an international website
but a cayman is not a crocodile......
Impresionante video
Woooooooooooiooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooow.
magnifique
OMFG!!!!! i thought crocodiles have a very hard skin!!! he really beat the most powerful animal ever!!!
Right in the brain cave
this is not crocodile this is alligator, in is very common in Brazil
It's not a crocodile, its a yacar√© (very small than caiman and crocodile).
No this is the internet.
The cat goes right for the spinal column just behind the head. Quick & efficient. The Cayman never knew what hit 'em
Actually YOU so stupid. We just had the first baby jaguar born here at the Jacksonville zoo. His name is "Khan" So YES, they are BREEDING, being BORN and ROAMING in Jacksonville here at the zoo. (GOOGLE IT) Chew on that.

go jaguar!!
It's not a crocodile, its a caiman. Calling that a crocodile would be like calling a cheetah a lion. Although caimans are crocodilians, they are must smaller and weaker than the average crocodile.
If I don¬¥t see it, I don¬¥t believe it!
first time i ever felt sorry for a crocodile... 
U don't get it, it's her baby, she's taking her by the neck like any other cat would :)
GET OVER HERE
wow.
Increible!
Can't begin to describe how majestic and lethally effective this is. I agree with Da Vinci.. cats are the most impressive lifeforms of the animal kingdom

America stretches from the Canadian Arctic to the tip of Argentina. The US is a country located in America, hence the full name United States OF key word OF America. US is the country, America is the continent it is located on.
cool
Continente Americano, desde alaska en el norte y hasta el sur Chile y Argentina , perooooooo se divide en " America del Norte, America Central y America del sur , y se dice latino america por el idioma no por su ubicacion geografica, y el pais no es America , es Los estados unidos de Amercia ,porque cada estado es independiente y tienen sus propias leyes,asi que antes de hacer un cometario , informate bien.

The jaguar was so cool, but I was hoping that the caiman would get away! I don't think the jaguar would have fared as well if it was a Nile croc or Australian "saltie".

All Gator's (Caiman are technically Alligators) and Crocs are of the family commonly called Crocodilians. 
Ta pasado ese gato!!!

oh shut up, I you just wanna know what he said because you are just too stupid to look it up!
Jaguars love to kill by crushing the skull. Nice guys
The narrator said it looked like the Jag bit into the Caiman's brain case or through the spinal/nerve column, because it stopped thrashing. It was essentially paralyzed.

si, tienes razon, si tampoco es tan exagerado de todas formas igual que un gato no se va a comer a una piton, un jaguar no se va a comer a un cocodrilo del nilo que come bufalos por eso tampoco es tan impresionante (me ha sorprendido eh) el cocodrilo es peque√±o, un caiman no?

I heard jaguars have a unique style of killing among the big cats. They have a different formed jaw than the leopards so they can brake the spine of the pray.

And? What happened after this? Cause the Jaguar carried the Croc back to the water where we all know the Croc has the advantage. In the water the Croc can do it's spinning thing and get the Jag off and go for the offensive.

No, we don't have crocodiles here in brasil, those are caimans, that one looks like either what we would call here a "Jacaretinga", or a "Jacar√© do pantanal", though i could be wrong, it might be a "jacar√© do papo amarelo", though all of them are of the "caiman" gender.

Nidalee OP 
Or a caiman
Both jaguar and on√ßa refer to the sane big cat, carniverous mammal. On√ßa comes from thr scientific name, panthera onca, and the name jaguar has origins from indigenous peoples (who lived in the present day Mexico - Some northern south american areas) who used a phonetically similar word to refer to that same big cat.
SANS COMMENTAIREÔªø
Porque un gato no es un jaguar, ni un cocodrilo una serpiente...
There is no crocodile in Brazil, it is an alligator. Just saying!
I did not know Crocodile's have YouTube, cause they should be the only ones to dislike this!!!
Oops.. I forgot that knowledge upsets some people.
Is he OK!?
some people just want to see world burn :D

Caiman: "I tot I taw a pooty cat about to have a dinner...I did! I did!....aww shit...I AM the dinner :("
I'm in shock! for the 1st time ever!
hahaha relly funny guys 
Wtf, Nidalee ganhando de renekton? deve t√° feedada!
 The ON√áA PINTADA is the Queen of the brazilian jungle! The fearst predator in Brazil! She eats whatever is in her pad. Humans are in the menu too. I heard many times people talking about the attacks in camping sites close to rivers and in the jungle.
fake and gay
Omfg renek no flash no nothing reported
oh my god, i thought dinosaurs had no predators
wwooo!!!!
and if you look in the description they are talking about a caiman but again crocodile and EXCLUSIVE VIDEO will bring the 4 million views not the caiman or alligator
should of shown more of the video post-kill
√© uma on√ßa e um jacar√© n√£o √© crocodilo nem jaguar!
oh ! le minou
the crocodile is much bigger than an alligator so if you say in the title crocodile, it sounds more catchy and more interesting to watch the conclusion: you are right about the alligator but it will not bring that much views as a crocodile :)

Damn Nature, You Scary!!!
HOLY SHIT 
It's a caimen
Cfocodile is a small...
better nerf nidalee
Crazy
Wow... never would have thought the teeth of a jaguar could pierce through the thick scaly skin of a crocodile!
Heavy metal is just noise, you could make better noise at home with your pots and pans. The commentary in this video is insightful, thorough and coherent. 
Amazing
There's a reason why pre-columbian people feared them so much . Thats one bad ass animal
Que top. O jaguar usou as mesmas t√°ticas do crocodilo pra peg√°-lo!
Counter's renekton 
Nidalee vs Renekton

Jaguar contra cocodrilo(When a jaguar pounces, sometimes one bite is all it takes to get a meal. National Geographic has exclusive video of a jaguar taking down a caiman in Brazil's... - See more at: http://fielinks.com/enlace/jaguar-contra-cocodrilo#sthash.Xp0x1yfK.dpuf)Ôªø
central brazil... man this was supposed to be africa
The caiman didn't even see it!
*Jaguar Attack*Jaguar Attacks Crocodile (EXCLUSIVE VIDEO)That's some catÔªø
Nidalee counters Renekton ;)
Si un humano puede levantar un gato adulto, por qu√© no puede levantar un le√≥n adulto? Pffffffff 
1. It is not a crocodile, is a caiman, different!; now, in South America the Jaguar is more dangerous than a lion or tiger in Africa and this video is a clear example of that. 
ohh its a puttycat
just WOOOW...
would like to watch the end when he ates it!
Increible!
Nidalee outplayed this rene absolutely!
ESO SI ES UNA CARA DE IDIOTA
thats why i always pick KING in tekken

After researching for about an hour yea mate, you're right!
WuuoOoo..
WuuoOoo..
Rengar is not jaguar...shut up.
ON√áA !
hehe .. better to keep your mouth shut and be thought a fool, than to open your mouth and remove all doubt.
You so stupid. Yeah the football team might not attack anything but last I heard jaguars weren't breeding and roaming in Jacksonville.
hahah
asdhisuahd 
Phreak: Hi Morello! Morello: Hi Phreak! Phreak: I think we need to nerf Rengar passive. Morello: Why so? Phreak : Look at this vid. Morello: WOW WE DEFINATLY NEED TO 
Damn that was something I would had never expected. What happened next?
SOUBHANA ALLAH
There are 25 species of caiman that live all over central and South America...not just in the Amazon
WOW! You must be a troll...no one could be that stupid. You clearly have access to the internet and can check, but let me help you out. There are 14 species of Crocodile. The twp you are referring to are likely the Nile and Saltwater respectively. There are crocodiles on every continent except Europe and Antarctica. The Everglades in South Florida is the only place where crocodiles and alligators naturally cross paths Crocodylus acutus/Alligator mississippiensis. 
loooooooooool xDDDDDDDDDDDD
So happy to hear that big cat lives either vegetarian life or can survive by eating air :) I think all you can say is they don`t attack you and you have never seen them attack.
I understand you don't like him or his music...but wishing death on someone like this is mentally disturbing. Get help.
Jaguar √© a on√ßa-pintada em ingl√™s. Mas de qualquer forma a National Geographic p√¥s o t√≠tulo errado. No texto chamam o Jacar√©-do pantanal de caiman que √© o nome em ingl√™s dessa especie, mas no t√≠tulo cometeram o erro de chamar de crocodilo. 
Strong nidalee
TRUST ME, this video is FAKE. I live in Jacksonville and I can tell you Jaguars don't attack ANYTHING!
Wow
Rengar i think...:)
Why your comment isn't up-voted a thousand times, I will never know.
Every video game > Lol
WTF!!! O.o
interesting video. Is the first time I see jaguar hunt a mrocodile.
sure, omg that noob renekton , nidalee now is too feed
√à no Brasil, certo no Pantanal, me desculpem se estiver errado, mas aqui n√£o temos Jaguar, mas On√ßa Pintada, e n√£o temos crocodilo temos "Jacar√©", que √© um pouco menor que o crocodilo, e o fucinho √© diferenciado com as narinas dispostas de forma diferente, espero ter ajudado, sem prejudicar ninguem!
DIOS que paso despues? XD nunca graban que pasa despues de lo importante
Increible

This is why nidalee is good vs renekton. 
That's not a Crocodile, the man himself said it was a Caimen. A group of species more closely related to alligators and are the smallest of all crocodilians.

Nidalee just ate Renekton. 
We just found out that: US has a black president; Hannah Montana is a dancing whore; Michael Jackson was murdered; Lens Armstrong won many titles just for being doped....Now we found that cats hunt crocodiles.... AMERICA... there is clearly something really fucked up in there.
report renekton
How the fuck does the Jaguar know where the brain is on a croc? Hell, I don't even know where it is exactly.
You can't get hit by Nidalee when she is far away, else you're doomed if you aren't tanky :P
*Jaguar Attacks Crocodile*Ôªø

omg seriously renek wtf ?? are u afk or what ? this gank was so obvious... reported
Cristiano Jaguar or Panthera onca is the name of "On√ßa-pintada" in english. The National Geographic is right about the "jaguar", but was wrong about the crocodile. In Brazil there are not crocodile, just alligators ("jacar√©s). And in this video is a "jacar√©-do-pantanal", a Caiman yacare. 
*Jaguar Attacks Crocodile*Ôªø
Title sells the video, only jews read descriptions ....
Onca pintada is a Jaguar.
damn cat ... the crocodile was sunning without disturbing anyone
ohhh fu*k!! dat vvas nice!!!!
Damn!!
Nature programmes just aren't the same with an american narrating

majestic animals! such a shame we are the only one who appreciate consumption instead than saving and sustain, so that they don't go extinct. Iam the part of the problem, we all are, for letting the leaders rule, over us, with no consequences, that applies to everything.. 
What has national geographic come to? This narrator sucks.
Pretty cool to watch. I like the commentator voice. Very clear and lively.

the jaguar is my favorite animal, he can kill everything.
cats are such vicious hunters.. lightning speed and reflexes, amazing stealth, precision strikes, razor sharp claws on all 4 legs, attack with front and back claws and also fangs, and just raw power.

nice hunt there, but lions are still the best.

The National Geographic made a mistake.There are not any species of the family crocodylidae in brazilian territory. Only the family alligatoridae. The animal attacked by the "On√ßa-pintada" (probably) is a "jacar√©-do-pantanal", a Caiman yacare. The correct title is "Jaguar attacks ALLIGATOR". 
Go home nature, you're drunk. 
How could this be fake?
WTF DAMN THAT JAG WAS NOT PLAYIN 
Fake
it seems that the Jaguar needed a pair of shoes !
Moron.
Caimans are alligatorid crocodylians within Caimaninae you moron. Also I would learn how to form a basic sentence with remedial grammar, before you pretend to be smart lol.

Does it make a difference if it was a caiman or a croc or an alligator? The point is that it got eaten by a fucking Jaguar
Like para Yaguito Perez xD jaguar¬¥s rules..¬°
*Jaguar Attacks Crocodile*Ôªø
Easy there, cowboy. It states it was a caiman in the description. I would assume the title reads "crocodile" because the vast majority of people would identify with it easier. It's probably more of an eye catching headline than a species they may not be familiar with. 
Rengar ganked renekton
‡∏Ñ‡∏ß‡∏¢
I think they did it for publicity wise. Crocodile is a much more well known name. Most people don't even know what a caiman is. I didn't know until a few days ago 
They used Crocodile, cuz 99% of people wouldn't click on this link if it said caiman.
THAT IS AWESOME!!!! H*LY CRAP!! HAHA
but the title still says Crocodile

but the title still says Crocodile
Actually most Jaguars are spotted. The black ones the same species with a slight gene variation. Sort of like how people are born with blond, black, brown, and red hair.
Well at least they call it a caiman in the video. 1 of 2 isn't bad :P
It's in the title only. In the video and description, they do say that they are caiman, rather than crocodiles.
Funny
If you watch the video he says Caiman.

it's not a crocodile , in Brazil we just have alligators ,there's not here crocodiles

My little pet
Oh shite lol cat came out of nowhere...
watching his little head bob along the river = priceless
Did him like a mother fucker... ._o
It was probably just some inexperienced and unknowledgeable intern that wrote the video title. At least the commentator knew what he was talking about, and did a very good job talking about it. Great vid
does not a crc , it's an alligator . there's no croc in Brazil . 
The other croc in the background got out of there pretty quick once he saw his buddy go down. He's probably relieved he chose to move banks last minute!
*Jaguar Attacks Crocodile*Ôªø
The Croc would win
That's not a crocodile, that's a caiman. I can't believe a respected channel like Nat Geo would confuse these two. Steve Irwin must be facepalming somewhere
nice. i wanna see an 18 ft tiger taking on an 18 ft croc next time. That should be named ufc heavyweight championship. A gold belt is on the line. And a lifetime supply of kills of course.
isn't it amazing how much you can learn when you pick up a book?

Incre√≠ble, excelente video
whoa. it will be ok. 
I want one image all the pussy you get just walking down the street with a jag on a chain leash 
its not a fucking crocodile. Its A fuCKing CaimAn. The uploader was a bloody idiot
and I'm stuck being a human.....
lol
You are one big FUCKING IDIOT!! ITS A CAIMAN, not a FUCKING CROCODILE!!!!!!! They're not the SAMe!!!!! DO YOUR FUCKING RESEARCH DUMBASSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!
grate now iv got a smudge on my screen your jerk (fuck my curiosity) 
Congrats NatGeo you just make yourself another splendid 'viral video'! I wish you guys can capture more footage like this!! :)
GO JAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGGGG
no. its just common knowledge to me. Black big cats in general are normally the result of high melanie in the skin and they are often refered to as "black panthers". So no. Jaguars are not normally black like that other guy was inquiring.
thanks 
Actually your right jaguar like the tiger has two variations. One is the most common form which is the spotted version. the difference between a leopard and jaguar spot wise. Is that a jaguar spots has a spot within its spots. The black jaguar is like the white tiger rare to see but not unheard of. even black jaguars have spot that cant really be noticed unless you are close up. I hope this helps. 
No comment...
I bet he mangled sa fuck out dat dere caman
Wow
Na verdade este animal e uma on√ßa pintada, n√£o e jaguar...
are u an expert mr...............
FUCK
no jaguars are normally this colour the black ones are normally the result of high melanism. 
no its a jaguar. It looks a lot like a leopard spot wise. but if you look closely you can see this small spots inside the spots. that's how you can tell its a jaguar. Also leopards and cheetahs avoid water like house cats. 
Na verdade esta √© a on√ßa pintada
OMG. CRAZY JAGUAR!
Fuck
Alligator... it's what's for dinner.
Oooooooooooo
Beast
A Lion/Tiger would tear a Jag. up any day of the week. 
This is Brazil \o/
I thought Jaguars are Black in colour, but this looks like a leopard.
I thought Jaguars are Black in colour, but this looks like a leopard.
yo quiero un gatito de estos...
Too bad there's not continuation. I'm not so sure the jaguar was able to bring the cayman to shore.
just for my correction, it seems to me a leopard or cheetah, but not jaguar, isn't it.
I mean... it's a "caiman"... but yeah
that jag is like my cat and that camain is like my feet
Never knew a Jaguar was so boss.
That jaguar is as big as the Cayman it self. Impressive animal. To think that it attack a heavily armored prey and knows exactly where to deliver that final blow is mind blowing!
That was a great video, thank you for posting. 
Damn nature, you scary!
just gained a lot of respect for jaguars
wow
Falto grabacion

Yeah, hate to burst your bubble but a small caiman is a far cry from a real crocodile, a Croc would've tore that jag a new ass hole and swallowed it in one gulp - you should change the title of this video, very misleading. 
Lol a person who likes crocodiles over jaguars...
crocodile rights activists...
I will gladly watch the majestic jaguar for the entire 2:02 Thank you..
It's a ON√áA !
WTF me qued√© sorprendido no mames

Bitch! I want to see the beginning too!
Wow
I love how the other one just disappears into the water. "Nope. Fuck this. Not today. No. Nope."
hmm really nothing funny ..
He's making gator boots
It's amazing that he picked that whole Caiman up with his mouth and started running with it. Wow, amazing.
I like your passion but a caiman would never hunt a jaguar they know better.
The narration is lame, but the attack is impressive.Ôªø
that's fucked up
My cat just had kittens 
Did chaosxsilencer commentate this video?
maldito jaguar hijo de mierda
i wanna be a jaguar... or an eagle... i wanna be an eagle.. 
*Jaguar ataca a caiman!*Ôªø
Why are people say shit like I'm glad it's dead or revenge or whatever? Shut the fuck up. It's nature. Sometimes the caiman hunts and jaguar and vice versa. Its how nature works. I swear its like half these people are in a children's cartoon where tge crocodile is the villian. They're not evil. They don't have the mental capacity to be evil. It's just nature and the circle of life.
wow
wow
go to sleep dude..no more procrastination for you tonight!
and they ask if animals can understand the world in which they live in and their place in it..their story. this is incredible. evolution at it's finest to hone such instincts. superb hunting, i'm impressed.
Esta loco es jaguar 
y desian algunos que el cocodrilo era mas fuerte que un leoperdo que epicooooooo
Calm the fuck down its only 2 mins, you really got better things to do ? 
This is natural, do not be ignorant
Crocodile: Man it's good be a Crocodile. I'm an Apex Predator. Nothing messes with me. Jaguar: Think Again. Crocodile: Oh crap!
The people above me and below this comment are stupid
This isn't a video to laugh at. Because of the human hunt against animals, this Jaguar has not dam, no life. If he hunt a crocodile is because it has no choice but to starve. There is time for laugh and there is time for reflection.
payback is a bitch watched a video where a bunch of alligators ganged up on a jaguar and end up hunting it. Fucking hate cros and alligators because they are pussies when alone 
Why do so many people hate reptiles so much? I remember watching a video where an alligator killed a jaguar and people were outraged. Now, I'm watching the opposite and people are satisfied. I rarely see any respect for reptiles. Well, back to doing homework. 
Well. That escalated quickly...
DAMN NATURE, YOU SCARY. 
what crap we are,, .. what a sad world we living now.. this is the beginning.. that kind of thing never happen before, that cat make that move because there's no options.. 
Watch the whole thing, its a good video
daaaaaamn that was so beast. he made that shit look easy
Jaguar is the "spanified" form of "Hawa", which is a pan-amerindian name for this mammal. In fact my own name derives from this ferocious animal. We have a small version of this cat, called "Jaguatirica" (Ocelot), or "Hawa-ter√™c√°", commonly described as such in many south american indigenous languages, which means "small hawa".
I thought I told yall not to be filming me when I'm trying to enjoy my supper!
LOOOOOL
his nickname is "el loco diablo gato" which means "the crazy devil/demon cat" in Spanish (I chose Spanish for it because it sounds better and easier to say) and it does fit and another nickname I have for him when he has the look on his face that fits it is: "psycho-kitty"

Jaguar kicked the Croc's ass.
hahahahaha wtf...

no , actually, I'm not. the only reason my cat never GETS to the children is because he knows there's a sliding glass door between him and "food"
wow im so tired i thought it was going to be a car attacking a crocodile...lol

Yes, both good points. However, I often see people call the Jaguar a Cheetah or Tiger at the zoo I work at. I still believe that the Jaguar is not as well known as one might think. The football and car company don't necessarily accurately reflect this animal in their designs.

Because you just criticized a Jaguar for killing an Alligator without presenting himself in an honorable manner before writing a note of intent. Animals don't give a shit about being fair, they do what the do to survive. Also, that Jaguar would rip off your face; shit on you; and murder your everyone in a five mile radius of you just because you farted a little too loud.

whoa
VENGO DE TN. 
Kick his ass, Sea Bass!
yyyyy? que paso? se lo comio, el caiman se lo comio a el? para que cortan el video... 
A degree? No, however I am earning my degree in zoology and work at a zoo. So I am indeed very knowledgeable on the subject. 
You're both wrong. It's one animal attacking another animal. BAM!
Dude you joined in on the conversation late. In my original post I said that they should change the name in the title from Crocodile to Caiman. Someone argued that they used crocodile because more people would know what that is. I argued that if that where the case, why didn't National Geographic call the Jaguar a Lion? Seeing as more people know what a lion is then a jaguar. 
i was thinking the same thing. lmfao
Kiddo, you are scratching right where I'm itching! The Big M, The Roadrunner, The Flower... be still my heart! I was in high school 76-81, for their four cups in a row, and it seemed they had to get through the hated Bruins every year. Hab a great weekend! Mark London ON

okay thanks jack hanna...
Nope. Crocodiles are not the prey of any other animal.
It's still a crocodile, just because it can be more accurately labeled an alligator doesn't mean shit. Get over yourself, please. If you want them to be correct, why didn't you want them simply calling it a caiman in the title? Do you see how retarded your logic is?
Oh damn whoever got to see that live & video tape it wow what a lucky person. I wish I could've seen that live! 
A HUMAN WOULDNT STAND A CHANCE
-.- 
Dwarf caiman yes. But others can usually grow to more or less 2 meters.Black caiman grow to about 5 meters. As for the title, it's marketing... If the title were "jaguar attacks caiman" I think that a lot of people would pass this video up just because they don't know what a caiman is.
Tigers do though...
That Jag would not attack a real Croc!!
KICK HIS ASS SEA BASS jk you got owned.

hunting with subtly ..
Amazing video clip!
Like the narrator said, that Jaguar knew what he was doing alright.
Stealthy as fuck, that crocodile didn't hear shit
it feels like im watching a golf game in the beginning... an interesting golf game...

Cocodrilo que se duerme es cartera...
Just in case you wanted another reason not to fuck with jaguars.
I am actually very knowledgeable on the subject. I am studying to become a zoologist and I work at a zoo. :) 
Don't feel smart, the guy in the video says that. Just because the one who posted it, who may not even be an expert in the animal field, named the video incorrectly, doesn't make them look bad at all. Great footage.
HeHe
Derp
The Colts are playing the Jaguars this Sunday. What chance do THEY have?
Crocodilia is their "Order". So yes alligators, caiman and crocodiles belong to the same order. However the caiman, as seen in this video, belongs to the family, Alligatoridae. Which only caiman and alligators belong to. BAM!
wtf ?? awesome!!!!
difil de creeeer!!!!!!!!!!!!
*Jaguar Attacks Crocodile*Ôªø
That Jaguar doesn't give a shit, he's bad ass!
ftw!
Surprise stupid cocodrile XD
I'm surprised people still don't know what crocodiles,caimans, alligators, gavialis, etc are :|
I bet the honey badger would kick jaguars ass xD
exelente cazador.
this guy sounds like a sports announcer
shitt :)
Even if that where true. It would be more accurate to say "Alligator" then it is to say "Crocodile". Alligator is also well known by the general public. Also if that where the case why would they not say "Lion Attacks Crocodile". More people know what a lion is. However, they use the actual animals name, Jaguar. Either way its still a fail by National Geographic. 
Como lo pela para com√©rselo????
At first glance I was thinking self lactating. I had to zoom in, even now when I see the heart it doesn't make too much sense.
Iomggggggg
I can no longer take crocodiles seriously anymore. That Jaguar dragged it off like it was an inflatable pool toy. I would love to see it take on Gustav. 
Suprise MoFo!
holy dam!!
wow haha !! 
The patience of the stalk is something else
Fuuuuuuck

Wow... that was crazy

how the hell do they film this
i dont think that it was a crocodile ,, 
PANTANAL!!!!!!!! 
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO CROCODILEEEEE
Fake. If you look closely you can see it's stop motion animation made with modeling clay.
Actually even though crocodiles are bigger the results would of probably been similar. Jaguars are pound for pound the strongest of all big cats and the have the strongest bite force of all big cats. 
Lol, love the commentary
jaguar looks like crocodile and vicevers

Go fuck yourselves, that's my opinion!!!!!!
DAMN, NATURE, YOU SCARY! Jaguar - #notgivingafuck
Lol, I love how the Caiman in the back was like: "I'm getting the hell out of here". Classic NatGeo. You need to put stuff like this on tv and calm down with the reality stuff.
Since cayman hunting is now forbidden (though it happens here and there) and also the egg-harvesting by local dwellers Nature must rely on jaguars and a few other predators to control cayman population or it will become a pest. One more reason to protect these big cats.
The jaguars were referred to as panthers in the Southern U.S. before hunted to near extinction.
your right DJ118USMC
it is brazil! all need protect this animals!!
it is brazil! all need protect this animals!!
Oh woo! You go jaguar !
Jaguar is known in brazil as "On√ßa Pintada" =]

Okay let's increase the difficulty a bit, shall we? Now I'd like to see a jaguar attack a hippo.
Jaguar Wins
I think the person who uploaded this video obviously made a mistake ..I think it still would have gotten the same amount of views if it said alligator..so I do have a fucking clue !!!!!!!!! 
no noise at all! no water splashes or anything! this jaguar is a legend
Interesting that Jaguars and occasionally Tigers can pull this off on crocodillians, but not Lions. Either those 2 big cats have more specialized hunting techniques, or the nile croc is simply too aggressive to be taken.
"smh" is the point I realized you would say something retarded. Retarded something say you did.
He's not a coward, it's called being smart not stupid, you retard
 #NatGeo   #Wildlife   #Jaguar   #Caturday  *Jaguar Attacks Crocodile* Ôªø
Gee.. they still grow pretty big...
LAZER ACCURACY - Pete Holmes
You're not 100% right. Type in "Caiman Alligator" and look at the Wikipedia link. 
National Geographic this is AMAZING footage! However, how can you get wrong the reptile being attacked? Its actually a caiman and its most closely related to an alligator not crocodile. Please fix the title, makes you guys look bad..........
no the reason why we root for the jaguar is because it is the "protagonist" of the documentary. We are learning its perspective and therefore feel more sympathy and attachment to it. I'll give you a cartoon example. It's like in Lion King 2 when Kiara goes hunting. We don't care about the antelope that she is hunting. We care about Kiara because she is the protagonist and the one that we have grown to know.
lol
*Jaguar Attacks Crocodile*Ôªø
Sneak attack hmph. smh he's just a coward I bet he couldn't fight him face to face!!
On√ßa-Pintada! (brazilian name, "dotted-jaguar") 
That is NatGeo's new direction. Gone are most of the good and informative nature productions from the past. In are the overdone and overdramatized reality tv style productions that we seem to not have enough of on tv.../s. It's unfortunate, I know.

How do crocs lose to jaguars
WTF is "Jaag-ooo-aaa-r" It is spelled "Jag-u-ar" How hard is that to say? Just fucking enunciate.
I wonder how it ends...
It's not a croc. 
The guy in the video said Cayman, which is an alligator, not a croc. Crocs are much more aggressive and are on average a little bigger. The jaguar wouldn't even have bothered let alone succeeded if it did attack. Of course most people, including you and the person working for nat geo who uploaded this don't have a clue. 
SURPRISE BUTT SECKS

I could be wrong be wrong but the jaguar seems to be one bad muthafucka
If only the Jacksonville Jaguars could pounce on their opponents in the NFL like this dude, it would make them Super Bowl champs!
if only the cars were as quick and powerful
What if there was other crocodiles on the water? the jaguar would be dead
well holy shit
Dope
That was awesome!
That was awesome!
This video is great and all, but now all I want to watch is jaguars killing shit and I can't find anymore videos
Damn! Nature, you scary.Jaguar surprise attacks a caiman... from the water.Ôªø
An amazing video! Gorgeous and powerful jaguar!

That was tight . Pussy from cat to women ain't nuttin to mess wit . Wen it Hungry lol
Puta madre que gatote tan culero

Lol. keep thinking that
Damn, that jaguar is one good assassin.

Jaguar ataca a cocodriloFuente: NationalGeographicEn la cuenta oficial de National Geographic en YouTube ha aparecido un espectacular v√≠deo. El incidente ocurri√≥ en los humedales del Pantanal de Brasil y su grabaci√≥n se hizo viral en menos de un d√≠a. El v√≠deo no muestra sangre porque se film√≥ desde lejos. Pero las im√°genes permiten convencerse de que la fama de animal letal que tiene el jaguar es m√°s que merecida.Ôªø

There is one large species of caiman in the Amazon Basin, and young crocodiles are smaller and sometimes eaten by jaguars.
Shes being creative and making a heart shape out of her tittie.

There s a HUGE difference between a cayman and a crocodile. no way a Jag would go after a croc.

Pra eles on√ßa e jaguar √© a mesma coisa :/ A tradu√ß√£o √© a mesma! E o jacar√© em ingl√™s √© crocodile aligator! Vai entender... 
N√£o sou brasileira. Nem estava falando mal do pa√≠s ou do povo, pelo contr√°rio, sou amante da l√≠ngua portuguesa seja de onde for. Apenas fiquei surpreendida por ver tanto coment√°rio a dizer que √© um jacar√© e uma on√ßa, quando o video √© ingl√™s, logo usa nomes ingleses para os animais, jacar√© sendo "caiman" (usado na descri√ß√£o do video, eles erraram no t√≠tulo ao porem "Crocodile") e on√ßa-pintada sendo jaguar. Aqui em Portugal, engra√ßado, usam-se as duas palavras, jaguar e on√ßa.

Nice
1 2 boom. I just killed a fucking camen. What did you do today?
Awesome!!
I swear, animated TV shows has lied to me. They make Jaguars look so huge and massive, not aying they arent, but compared to other big cats, they arent.
:o incredible
Caiman, not crocodile. Cool video. 
Look at my Tits pls!
Why don't you just show the footage, or at least talk over it like it's a documentary? It sounds like commentary on a football match! Is this how dumb the average viewer is nowadays that they need nature videos to sound like sports?
It is not a Jaguar, it is an On√ßa

how about i let my crocodile on you 
my cat likes to hunt children and the jaguar is hunting a caiman and (scarily enough) it looks like when my cat hunts children
No, I just don't see what is so important about waste full beings burning precious energy. Life only hastens the death of the universe.
fucking beautiful! 
fucking beautiful! 
A direct attack on a croc who knows your there is suicide with those crushing jaws, but the muscle for opening them is weak. Where as the jaguar is using his head, speed and stealth. Its like a ninja with a knife getting the jump on a guy with a rocket launcher, that firepowers useless if your can't reload it in time.

Even like that you gotta admire the jaguar, he went inside the water and attacked the camen without him noticeing he was coming from the water
The cats not the king. The king cobra is the king
No self value, well reflected in comment. Sad... for you.
"Nature" doesn't need saving: life will ultimately continue on, in some form. A lot of (human) folks that worry about saving the planet are only or mostly interested in their own habitats. There's nothing wrong with that, but they ought to be more upfront about what they truly mean.
Bad. Ass.
That is an Badass.
People forget the jaguar is the third largest Big Cat.

Read between the lines. If a 4'11 man that weights 75 lbs ambushes you in your sleep and slashes your throat with a knife is he stronger than you? No, this is exactly what happens here. Crocs are very sluggish on land, all this croc was doing is most likely basking in the sun taking a little rest. It's also small asf

Herp, derp. You say this as if he's opposing you or something. A specialized hunter knows what to attack and what not to attack. Unlike humans, it can process what will or won't be plausible.
Woah 
Jag must have needed a new purse !
Another example of why you won't see my ass on no jungle safari no time soon. That caiman/gator was one and done, had absolutely no clue it was about to end. Reptile steaks for everybody. Damn...

Over-confidence can be a fatal mistake. Surprise is the ultimate weapon and believing too much in being safe is deadly. Being paranoic is a better choice.

Jaguars have the strongest bite force of all big cats. They are bad asses and my favorite along with lions.

Yes. A Camen is in the CROCS FAMILY! THEREFORE THE JAGUAR IS ATTACKING A CROC!
It's easy for people to act the Fool, when they don't have to face the person they're being crude too. ~shama lama ding dong~ :)
They're smart animals, it probably know that humans are likely to be a dangerous target & are to be avoided if possible. Only as a last resort if they can't find anything else they'd go for humans. Plus humans probably aren't one of the 85 species they go for.
Oh, the irony
Do you notice something National Geographic noone cares about fucking war or drugs. You should post more like this on the channel

Yes, Wikipedia does cite many of it's sources. However, you would would not cite Wikipedia, you would cite the source Wikipedia obtained the information from. Since you already knew that Wikipedia cites articles, why would you not refer them to the original article where the information was obtained? Now, aside from that, even if you did refer them to the original article that still is not proof of anything except that someone said something that may or may not be true.

bronze 5 dont buy wards...
WTF are you sure that was a crocodile?? the jag just picked it up with his teeth like it was nothing and from what i heard crocs are some heavy animals.
fuuuckkk he came out of nowhere!! 
Gangsta 
Why ? Crocodiles and Aligators is strongest then big cats .
Are you kidding me? A leopard just hunted a crocodile!!!!!! I will die for see this scene with my own eyes.
i know..lol..bunch of pointless videos topic about nothing(non sarcastic)..

all of the videos to the right are from National Geographic.

THIS IS BRASIL
whao
Absolutely agree!!! What could possibly be the common denominator tagging for this?
Bon app√©tit!
Nice
Why did it fade out so suddenly?? Show us all of it!
I agree entirely!!! So many, almost to exclusion, in these kinds of bits the "background music" drowns out the on scene conditions, so that what you hear literally is some bloke banging away on a tin garbage can and the narrator whispering as though he/she were some on-site Peeping Tom... The animal is of course oblivious to the garbage tin being beaten to a frenzy...
jaguar yu
It's not a crocodile or an alligator. It's is an JACAR√â (zhakareh')‚Äîmore precisely a Jacar√©-do-Pantanal. And the name of the jaguar in Brazilian Portuguese is ON√áA (on'ssa).
Man, that's a beautiful animal. And strong! That cayman was as big as the cat! And the briefest of struggle. Just amazing.
If you think that's amazing. Wait until you see my video when I wrestled with a Crocodile MYSELF with my Bare Hands!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I am awesome.... Ain't I !
Rengar ganking on Renekton lololol
Awesome.
that's how it used to be...then they changed it for some reason.
So well said! I'm so glad you mentioned the "music." What is up w/ that? As if the action that is happening isn't dramatic enough, they have to spruce it up w/ some idiotic soundtrack to intensify the already suspenseful event.....Why?? It just gets in the way, discredits, & trivializes the essence of the story. Great comment!
Where is the rest of video? Why would you cut it off at that point?
that's a fucking strong jaguar man... Picked that bastard up in his mouth and took the fuck off haha :)
No sh!t! I want to see the rest of the vid! 
Loved the footage. I especially liked the commentary by Dr. Luke Dollar. Everything he said was educational and to the point, as it should be. Narrators of documentaries in general should take a leaf from Dr. Dollar's book.
Jaguar caught Crocodile in the back. What happens if both of them was in front each other?
In Jaguar's stomach 
It's because they are all posted by NationalGeographic, just like this Jaguar video. It looks like you didn't connect the dots :)
Like a boss
Great video, but what happened after it? Did the Jaguar get the Yacare caiman back to the mainland or did he eat it on the island? I saw another second Yacare caiman in the back moving into the water as the jaguar attacks the frontal Yacare caiman. Where did he go?
hahah isee..
yep its another one in the back and its gets into the water as soon as Jag catches the Croc....Nice observation... 
Jaguars kill anacondas too.
is it me or is there another croc (or something) a little north after the jaguar attacks the croc? something moves in the water as if it was running away or trying to save the croc. 
Croc must have said WTF WTF WTFfffffff ff f ffff f .f.....
They are all videos posted by Nat Geo.
Jaguars are known for their Humane way of killing their prey, by usually breaking their prey's neck. ...and that wasn't a crocodile, it's a caiman.

woow, das krododil hat sich nicht einmal gewehrt, respekt was so eine katze alles kann ;D
flawless victory! fatality!!
That's good :) At least some people know
Could have something to do with that homemade "Krokodil" drug that is becoming more and more popular? Crocodile -> Krokodil Dunno, just a thought.
That's one cool cat.
Just amazing. I wish all Natural Geographic clips were like this, by the way, with the calm, casual narration by someone who is obviously familiar with the organisms involved. No strained, hoarse movie-trailer voiceovers; no action-packed music; no overambitious visuals except the one helpful slo-mo shot. Much more nature TV should be like this.
That mufucka like a navy seal
Yes. But it doesn't always have to do with relation to the video -Youtube selects videos from the same user as interest/relation to the one being watched. 
It's a NatGeo production. That's all.
Great vid but looking to my right, WTF has a Drugs Inc San Francisco Meth Zombies video got to do with this video? Not just that all the vidz to my right have no relation to this video. Anyone else noticed that?
like a ninja^^ or ninjas be like wild cats?

Cats are the ultimate land predator. They top dogs by a wide margin. Compare any wild cat to a wild dog.
not you
Woow
:( Please, just please look up what a jaguar is. For all of us. And I don't mean the car.

Oh I know I commented again to say that jaguars can be black too. I guess you didn't see it. :) sorry

Leopards exist in the "Old World" of Eurasia and Africa. Jaguars exist in the "New World" of the Americas. This video is from Brazil. You know "Americas". How does it feel to be insistent in showing the world that you are a stupid fuck?

Hjhgjhhu
Keep repeating your ignorance, I suppose.
Holy crap!
That was awesome! I want a jaguar.
Mick Jaguar.
THIS IS AWESOME! Wow!!! Didn't know this could be possible! Holy Christ, why ain't I subscribe for NG channel?! Gonna fix it right now

Yo, Scump. I hope you like this vid, lol it was gnarly as fuck.
That jaguar has real balls

Damn nature, you sca... oh, are we done using that meme? Alright.
Less than just 3 seconds and he is totally in control!! 
love the jaguar but sad for the croc. nature red in tooth and claw
Definitely an adult, no doubt it's a child, none
You're wrong. Panther is just a general name that is given to different species, such melanistic (black) jaguars, black leopards, florida pumas, etc.
This was a surgical strike carried out with military precision by the jaguar. Well done, Simba!
This is a kind of Jarguar. It looks like a leopard, but it is not... it's bigger than a leopard. Leopard only exists in africa. In america, we have jarguars. This one is called "on√ßa pintada" in Brazil, which means literally "jaguar with spots".
INCREIBLE !!!!
Jaguar vs. Caiman. And no, this isn't a car comparison test.Ôªø
Most amazing thing I've seen in months!
He came out of the water like fucking Rambo.
It's exactly the same species, which receives many names in different countries. Jaguars are called jaguar, yaguaret√©, on√ßa pintada, tigre criollo, overo, manchado, etc. Exactly the same happens with the puma, which can be called on√ßa parda, puma, cougar, mountain lion, catamount, or florida panther, but it's the same species.
Who would want to go golfing down there!.....very impressive...
That was pro...
Nope jet black big cats are called panthers
Damn nature, you scary.
Eso es un Yacar√©. No un cocodrilo. Es una especie menor. Not a Crocodile
DAMN LOL
Nidale OP
??? GULP , JAGUAR AS A KAMIKAZE SUPER CAT !!!
–ö–ª–∞—Å—Å!
Jaguar has bigger spots
glorious kill 
Not the video. The video is correct. The guy I was answering to was saying the animal is a leopard, when it's in fact a jaguar. Have a good day ;)
Very cool video, annoying commentary. "He's good.... one two and boom!" Let the video speak for itself. 
SubahanAllah..
Are you insane?
REALLY ITS AN AMAZING VIDEO THAT SHOWS THA THE TEAM IS REALLY GREATWE RA REALLY GRATEFUL THANK YOU 
In fact, the melanistic (black) Jaguars are common in some places in South America.

Absolutely pro; nature doesn't fuck around.
HAHAHA! watch the caiman in the background too. Dude was like FUCK THAT and dipped
Jaguars can be black too.
DAMN NATURE! you are scary
In Brazil we call this animal "on√ßa". Our little pussycat :D
Since it is in Brazil, it's called On√ßa-Pintada.
WOW!
Damn nature u scary!!
Damn nature u scary!!
wow that's amazing
Fuck off for putting Crocodile in the title..
The guy/girl is saying the animal in the video is a leopard and not a jaguar. Ignoring the differences in looks and behaviour, leopards live in Africa, while Jaguars live in South America, where the video was taken. 
I Want More
Jaguar dont give a f.u.c.k.
Heh, or it could get work as a cook on a tramp steamer. The crew might get tired of raw meat and crushed bones but there is that.
no vengas!!!! se lo comio okeeee
Jaguar don't give a fuck ._.
Dude. It was meant to be funny. Jesus. Give the guy a break..
You have to be a special kind of person to insistently argue that Jaguars do not live in South America. Don't argue a topic on which you have no knowledge. Educate yourselves.
mistaken*
If i'm not mistake, Jaguars have the strongest bite force of all the Big Cats.
C A L A B O C A 
What are you talking about?
Real Cat! +555555555!
Kieran, no. There are black jaguars and black leopards
NO SHIT. Are you gonna say me that there are some Canadians that live in Canada, too?
Sergio, no. It is a jaguar, that is the same as On√ßa. But you're right about the Jacar√©, it i really different from a Crocodile.
it could be done...float on a log, catch fish on the way. maybe cudda....
suban el video completo!!!!!!
LOL Oh I totally agree!! 
Fucking retard. I am brazilian, and we do not have leopards here, you piece of shit. if ur gonna insult others, i am gonna insult you.
Jaguars are even more scary now
Wouahh
A leopard in South America?... It swam the whole 2000 or 3000 km?
Hola!!

GG NOOB RENEKTON REPORT. NO WARDS.
I love the big , ( and small), cats , and hate all the crocs. and alligators type things,

That is fucking awesome

Thumbs up if Google doodle brought you here :P
Panthers can be tan as well though (like in florida). Black leopards and black jaguars are called panthers but they are still leopards and jaguars. And i'm not trying to be a smart ass it's just facts. You don't have to start name-calling because you disagree.
Real Cat!
I think a leopard would be too tired to kill a caiman after swimming the Atlantic as well. LOL

pound for pound the toughest cats
In the cat family the genus Panthera consist of 4 big cats. Panthera leo - the lion, Panthera tigris - the tiger, Panthera pardus - the leopard in africa and asia and Panther onca - the jaguar in America. The term "panther" is almost a nickname for black varieties of jaguar and leopard and a Florida cougar.

Black Panthers include Melanistic Jaguars and Melanistic Leopards. Oh yeah, and Malik Shabazz.

jajaja
me gusta ver la agilidad que los jaguares pueden tener en estas situaciones, adem√°s de que los felinos son para mi animales asombrosos 
That was sweet!
You can also tell that it's not a leopard because it's so unlikely that a leopard swam the Atlantic Ocean from Africa to South America. LOL
My next car Jaguar! :D
that was just SICK! Goes to show you being a top predator does not give you the luxury of letting your guard down. 
Jauguars can also be black.
cats rule the land
crazzzzy 
thats a Jaguar idiot. Leopard doesn't take splash into river to kill its prey. plus, leopard doesn't kill its prey by crushing the skull. Only Jaguar does.
holy shit
amazing is the Mather Earth
Plus, Jaguar's are found in Central and S. America. There's not a lot of buffalo in the jungles there. Jags eat mostly Caimans, deer, snakes and tapirs. 
Your can tell it's a jaguar by it's spots. Leopards and jaguars have different shaped spots. And it's leopards that can be black (also known as black panthers).
Damn nature you scary!
Damn nature you scary!

Rather smart.

‡πÅ‡∏°‡πà‡∏á‡πÄ‡∏à‡πã‡∏á‡∏ß‡πà‡∏∞
Panthers are color morphs of Jaguars...therefore, Panthers ARE Jaguars. If you see them in the light, you can see the faint outline of their spots on their shiny black coats...
Not being naive mate. Look it up. Jaguar's have the most powerful bites of all big cats and also use the skull-piercing technique seen here, which is unique among big cats. That was all I was saying. It's because they are the most opportunistic predators out of all big cats and also have the widest diet. They need the bite power to crack through turtle/armadillo shells and, as you can see, Cayman's skulls. They also kill various mammals in the same way. 
My dream car used to be a BMW.....I just changed my mind
That is literally what I said. Thanks for summing it up.

Dear Brothers And Sisters: [Uncle Sam = Atheist_WHORE!]

Did you just really?! It's a jaguar you turd waffle. You think you know better than a National Geographic Explorer studying big cats? Dr. Luke Dollar has a Ph.D. in Ecology and around 20 years of experience. While you've been listening to MCR, he's been going around the world studying life in its different forms. You can't even use Google it seems.
That's really cool

Nerf jaguars!
Nerf jaguars!
Nnn
Go to google and type in "jaguar vs leopard" they're almost identical. I think what you're thinking of is a panther. Panthers are black
WOW !!!
Leopards live in Asia, Africa, and the Middle East while Jaguars live in South and Central America. Leopards and Jaguars are similar so it's understandable, I had to keep checking before I was sure it was a Jaguar.

*Video Of A Jaguar Attacking A Caiman - Business Insider**In August, National Geographic caught incredible footage of a large male jaguar stalking and lunging onto the back of a caiman ‚Äî a cousin of the crocodile native to South America ‚Äî as it was hanging out on the shore along Brazil's Tres Irm√£os River.**"With one bite, the big cat likely delivered an immediate blow to the caiman's central nervous system, leaving the animal unable to fight or flee," conservation scientist Luke Dollar told National Geographic*http://www.businessinsider.com/video-of-a-jaguar-attacking-a-caiman-2013-9Ôªø
It's okay to be wrong. Really, it's fine. If you had simply looked up a jaguar's range compared to a caiman's, then seen where a leopard lives, you may have ended up not being wrong. But you didn't. So you're wrong. 
I really enjoy watching this kind of video
Nice kitty.

A lot of reptiles and other animals freeze under certain circumstances. Without seeking the several seconds that follow this clip it really is not clear how it ends.
...except that's a caiman.
IN EUA is a Jaguar and is a fucking Crocodile! So GTFO.
That is incredible! I also find it spooky that it knows instinctively where to bite to immobilize its prey. Some animals are messy killers and start eating their prey while it's still trying to get away.
What? I want to see the dinning experience as well!

I can't even lie, Our team does suck. Maybe if we pick-up Tim Tebow like the fans wanted to in the first place, then we will see some improvement. Our current quarterback has great physical attributes (6'5, 240 lbs, runs a 4.5 40 yrd dash, ect.), but he doesn't have the pro football intelligence like Peyton Manning or Drew Brees. And he doesn't read the defense well, thus sending Maurice Jones-Drew into a fending frenzy of LB and Safeties when they do Blitz plays instead of calling an audible.

Not only is he good at swimming and stalking, his strength is unbelievable.
At maximum it is a alligator....lol 
Oh My God.
On the bright side, if one does decided to pounce on you, at least it will be over quickly.
It is exactly what I said before... the guys answered to me... hey! it is a sinonimous.... cameon...
Wow!!!!
man, this jaguar has balls...
WOW!!! Depredador contra depredador.
Both a crocodile and a alligator would tear a Jaguar a new one. This is a Caiman they are much smaller.
So awesome

i think so,"The jaguar has the strongest bite of all felids, capable of biting down with 2,000 lbf (910 kgf). This is twice the strength of a lion and the second strongest of all mammals after the spotted hyena; this strength adaptation allows the jaguar to pierce turtle shells"-Wikipedia

The Jacksonville Jaguars should renamed themselves the Jacksonville Caiman Crocodile instead.
Thats it? I thought we were gonna see it eat.
Amazing :O
Nat Geo. Has redeemed themselves with this footage... But Doomsday Castle is like Nat Geo's. red headed step child, the show blows!!
Esta de pinga..
Sounds like Joe Rogan is narrarating
Holly Shit !!! unbelievable. respect the jaguar.
are alligatorid crocodylians within the subfamily Caimaninae.
tan falso como las galletas de animalitos
O_____O
and they lived happy ever after??
que loucura meuuu !!!! 
Jags are tough players !
I always wonder how they record stuff like this.
When referring to the animal it's definitely written as Caiman. Cayman is only referring to the Cayman Islands which is a geographic place. Caiman = alligator Cayman = tropical islands where you can get your pina colada on.
is a cayman a croc? 
Damn nature, you scary
Fucking take-away 
PLEASE STOP USING SMALL LETTERING,IT NOT GOOD FOR YOUR EYES.ALWAYS LISTEN TO THE DOCTOR
PANTANAL!!! 
I NEED TO SEE THE REST OF THE VIDEO
Regardless of the reptile in question, and the differences between narration and video title, this is an awesome video. And I have now seen Caimen, Cayman, and do not know what the proper English spelling is. Where are the Grammar Nazis when you need them?
Haha!! I just noticed that too! 
you realise you can turn caps off right?
BRAZIL HUEHUEHEU
MTV nough said
lol ddn't even see that and this is literally what i just said to her 
Lmao, <3 your comment.....and you only had to use three simple words - BRILLIANT! xD
you realise that we used to do stuff like this thousands of years ago right? it's more amazing that we are now the only animal on the planet who took itself out of the food-chain
according to every report on jaguars I have read/watched they regularly hunt them.
Thats a caiman not a crocodile.
You have issues
Big cats have been around for 55 MILLION years, and the Crocodylia body form, that yes includes Alligators, has been around for almost 200 Million years...........humans aren't going to even survive a million before we blow ourselves up. That's all I'm saying =P

yes but still a joke compared to a nilcrocodile. black cayman = max 300kg while nilcrocodile = easily over 1000kg
the cayman belongs to alligator family, not crocodiles

pos LMFAO YOU PIECE OF SHIT
well at one time we were so good at surviving we removed ourselves from the food chain
they taste just like chicken...maybe a little on the chewy side.
Cuban and American Crocs live in S. America
that's just crazy (and yes it's a 'croc', not a gator as i mistakenly typed)
wowwwwwwwwwwwww
and for that mater they would have no trouble not only dragging it away, but getting it up into a tree
this is what I thought Nat Geo was gonna be about...not 'drugs inc' or 'doomsday preppers'. Education regarding our wild animal friends may do much in the way of helping saving their environment as well as our!!!!!!!!

That was a caiman. Not as big as a crocodile
has to have pretty strong jaws to pick up a gator like that
Matar esses jaguar !
Kill Jaguar!! 
Black caiman can be 20' long
Since the narrator clearly identifies this as a caiman at the time I'm sure whichever intern uploaded it just mislabeled it. However, the American Crocodile and the Cuban Crocodile are both present in S. America, though it's not likely they would be that far south. 
HOLY SHIT! :O :O :O You know what watching Nat. Geo. constantly reminds me of? How boring and blegh human beings are! xD

wow
*MUITO LOKO*Ôªø
amazing ! jaguar's look good 
I'm kinda concerned about NG....Crocodiles' in South America?
lol! Caymans are alot smaller, a jaguar would have no chance against a full grown african crocodile, he cant drag it away cause it would be way to heavy
Wow, National Geographic. Is that a caiman or a crocodile?
If they are, it's not because of jaguars.
other fact is , it takes toooooooo long to suffocate something that can withstand to be under water for 30 minutes or more ... 
V√≠deo exclusivo de National GeographicÔªø

don't be naive ... he went like this on cayman because it requires different technique... you can't get a reptile by the throat because it's too low and too dangerous , as it would be stupid to go on buffalo like this because of the horns and fact it's neck it much ticker to bite trough ... 
Like exactly what always happens in nature? Fucking dumbass cuntface
Is there any significant difference between a Cayman and a Crocodile? Or are these just named "Cayman crocodiles"? 
That's a bad boy!Ôªø
I bet that is what Honey Boo-Boos' family looks like attacking a buffet. 
That's right, It's a Cayman, there are no Crocodiles in South America
wow
Amazing
Damn nature, you scary!

The caiman never had a chance. One of the best videos ever. I've already watched it a dozen times.

Great Camera work! What camera did you use?
So we don't get to see what actually happened then?
Nice
cool 
Caiman tacos!
But what's he going to do with it? He has to let go at some point and get another, a more killing grip?
awesomesauce!Ôªø
This reminds me of that Family guy flashback "Damn nature, you scary!"
hahaha nice one
Very big mouse...
Jaguar's are the most efficient killers of all the big cats. Other big cats maul, fight and go for the throat. Jaguar's are the only ones who bite into the brain like that. Instant kill, take-away dinner. 
And to think that Jaguars once lived here in California, as far north as Monterey (1/2 way up the coast!). I hope they come back here in the United States. Their buddies the Cougars probably miss them. 
Damn nature, you scary.

That's fucking scary
 What next? 
Now i know why they pick Ad nida vs Rene
second caiman was like "I AM OUTTA HERE!!!!!"
:D
:D
I would like to see what happened next.
That jaguar is the chuck norris of cats. Not the biggest baddest scariest, but he will mess you up.
kinda reminds me of the hungarian uprising
Jaguar has a power that was clear, but so that he can even cut through the tough tankskin of the Cayman like butter through bites, I would not have thought.
What an amazing creature, both of them really.
wow! Dangerous hunt! 
F.E.D., a private bank, can do the same with our money. 
who feed nidalee !!! ?
veej get a life boy 
luke dollar can suck a dick for being an awful narrator
God knew how to build them ! that was awsome 
now thats pure example of why cats are better!!! 
WHO FED RENGAR?!?!?
Lunch time 
I didn't know crocs and the like were part of a jaguar's diet.
Hard to believe,so brave that jaguar.
That wasss cooooool :))
Cat is so Raw!!!!
Nature rocks, too bad we humans are messing it all up.. Do you guys have any idea how much better the world would be if liberals hadn't came along to protect the crocs from the cats??? ( its a hypothetical ) 
That's one bad kitty
WOW! I new knew they would prey on a reptile!

Okay, shut up with that.
If you ever decide to fight any big cat, the point about guarding the brain, is moot, its ptobbably not that useful anyway.. 
Too bad the Jacksonville Jaguars are not living up to their mascots reputation as a fighter and winner
Poor Gator, the jag didn't let him finish playing "Where is my water" 
Damn Nature, you scary
so is the jaguar.
Report Nida, without any bushs extra Movementspeed.

if you're ever in a fight with a jaguar, guard your neck and brain!

Wooow

Lol geilo
Woow.. this Jaguar really has a lot of experience and she/he is quite courageous because there is a high risk to attack a crocodile.
When the hunter becomes the hunted. 
When the hunter becomes the hunted. 
CAIMAN NOT CROCODILE PLUS GREAT FUCKING COMMENTARY YOU PIECE OF SHIT
omg 
lmao
It was a joke!!!
sure they do but big cats are usually giving them hard times... there is a vid on youtube when pretty big croc grabs cheetah in some shallow lake, cheetah -although not really built for that kind of fight- managed to bite him once or twice and after 5 minutes of struggling she managed to get away
they went to close when they shaved your head.....
Renekton didn't even ult wtf..
Concorda comigo que no Brasil n√£o tem crocodilo? esses americanos s√£o t√£o idiotas,que n√£o enxergam um palmo alem dos estados unidos!

OK, I have to say I when I clicked on the video I was expecting to see it attacking a bloody big croc, but a cayman,...not surprising that he had the guts and survived :D
He finally has some crocs
He finally has some crocs
Awesome! 
caimans are crocodiles
Dang nature. You scary.

Damn Nature! You Scary...
I thought I posted that sarcasm as a reply. Well shit!
Be funny if a much larger alligator snatched the jag right as he did it lol
Exactly what I was going to say....Freaking Awesome!
amazing video. I always want to know how crocs or alligator being kill by other predators
How does he bite through the thick hide?Ôªø
That was freaking awesome.... That big beautiful cat knew exactly what he was doing as it just sunk its teeth into the spinal cord of that cayman and it was all over... The little kitty knew exactly where to bite it to kill it... Freaking Awesome...
If that were the case, humans would need to go to the top of the list...
Shoulda been bobbin' and weavin'!
I the crock would have bitten him in stead of run, he might still be alive today.
Commentary back then for National Geographics used to sound a whole lot better...
V√≠deo exclusivo de National GeographicÔªø
When a jaguar pounces, sometimes one bite is all it takes to get a meal. National Geographic has exclusive video of a jaguar taking down a caiman in Brazil's Pantanal wetlands, photos of which went viral earlier this month. Luke Dollar, a conservation scientist who helps manage National Geographic's Big Cats Initiative, explains the hunt and explosive moment of predation.Ôªø
badass better not let peta see this video
Excellent video, good job!!
Liking the suspense, but finish your quote!
Great video
Caiman are crocodylians. 
Ha you just got your neck bit lol
*checks the ledger* I don't know. It says here we can use a few more.
KILL ALL THE SCARY AND UGLY CREATURES!
other caiman on the far bank 1:37 "nothing to do here"
balls to hunt gators
gotta love big cats.. the jaguar took that thing out like a boss.. mike tyson in the hey days
That's amazing!
Kitty goes nomnomnom
Solo buenoÔªø
sweeeet 
Cats, whether domestic or wild, have got some serious balls. I'm not talking in a literal sense. So freakin' intelligent and absolutely no fear crossing a croc infested river. Amazing.

i wanted to see him eat it
Why do you hate "all those cold blooded reptiles"?....Because you fear them?
Why do you hate crocs and snakes?.... Because you have a fear of them?
Incredible !!! Totally focused on the task at hand...
We goto McDonalds for a meal. Jaguar's go to the river.
This right here is the true definition of stealth. That croc never knew what hit him. 
what an enigma...
I hate crocodiles and snakes so I'm OK with this.

That's why I love felines. After seeing this Jaguars are definitely one of my favorite felines. I hate crocodiles, caymans and all those cold blood reptiles.
um...obviously?
Holy shit nature. you are fucking insane.
Good for the Jaguar. Too many reptiles anyway
natures bad ass
How can I see the rest of the video?
crazy
Shit dope. 
the most bro out of the feline family. such a bro
My new favorite animal 
they eat crocs?
luv the narration lol... "that's a meal he's taking away to have at his convenience"
Protect Ya Neck-Wu Tang Clan
Holy
Actually, the Jaguar didn't eat him. He took him home and they had a glass of wine while they discuss various socio-political movements of the early 1800s.
Wish we could have seen how he ate this large "meal" as the video ended too prematurely. And I wonder how the jaguar would have reacted if the caiman got a bite in but alas, we will never know.
Cool video Nat Geo. This is why I subbed. 
Deep giggle! You siiiiiiiilly....lol!
he's like the pit bull of cats.
Hahahahahaha!
Isn't THAT the BEST way to eat it? When it's not moving (all over the place)? Lmao....
Me, either! I'm just as shocked as you are! LOL!
Took the words right out of my mouth. But then again, had they said that...not many would know it's not a man from the Cayman islands....!
ROTFLMAOOOO!!!! Hahahahahaha! Too funny! I said the same thing!!
He'll probably break camp and roast it over his already roaring, open fire! LOL! That'll soften that tough meat.
we want fucking whole video ..wht happen after tht .. Jaguar eat crocodile and digest or nt
LOL! I was wondering why this video was titled incorrectly. Caiman's are much smaller than their much larger cousins and to see a Jag take down a humungous salt water Croc? Now, THAT definitely takes some mad skills!
Wait. Are you asking "Is a Cougars' attack as stealth as a Jag's?" Good question and I would think it would be but...they are cut/built a bit differently. I think a Jag would be stealthier because it's not as bulky, and its' body is more streamlined than a Cougar. 
He's got the moves like jaguar.
He's got the moves like jaguar.
What?
They cut the video because in the end the caiman eats jaguar. 
For REAL! I wanted to see how he ate it...and how did he get around that scaly back. Does he go for the tender underside? Is the Caiman still alive when eaten? What?!? 
LOL! He SURRRRRE did. Now that's cool footage!
EXACTLY!! I was like..WTH'd you stop rolling footage for!?! I wanted to see the rest....! NOW, THAT was EXCITING! That Jag was BOSS and I loved it! Makes me think of when I had a cat at different times in my life, or rather, when each of my daughters were young and BEGGED me to allow them a kitten. They are some quiet, beautiful, stalkers...lol.
Makes you rethink who the King of the Jungle actually is. 
The Crocodile was probably like "today I am gonna go tan a little and the go home and play some GTA 5 ........ 
Good
what happens in the end? WTF 
i wanna be that puma
WHY DID YOU CUT THE VIDEO?!?
Strong as fuck
also fake. 
Gay, needs more twilight
Is cougars' attach as stealth?
My favorite animal such precision I wish there was more of it to view
At the very end of the video the narrator sounds like Will Ferrell in "The Other Guys". THe part where he's explaining to Mark Whalburg how his people (open sea Tuna) is going to hunt down his (Mark Whalburg's) lion people.
he didn't kill that . 
Dang!
You're correct, but how many people know what a Caiman is? Alligator/Crocodile = more hits on searches!
The jaquar couldn't of done it without help from the government.
Awesome
i got two cats myself, this happens everyday in my house.
lol its their majority diet. 
thats a big cat!
Yay jag!
The jag needed some tough shoes for trekking in the water and possibly a matching belt. Certainly can't digest that tough carcass.
LIKE A BOSS! GO SOUNDERS!
Damn, rear view mirrors needed!
They should change the title to "Jaguar Attacks Caiman", The title is misleading.
I didn't know caiman's were on the jaguar diet.
swift kill! 
swift kill! 
cats swimming and eating reptiles, so much of that river adventure i was planning.
That croc never hurt anybody. NOT
Thumbs up for nature!! 
Thanks for your interpretation. I am an animal kingdom enthusiast and have to tell you that I have heard this phrase seemingly thousands of times. Lions live in jungles, for they were there last week as I watched the show for two hours.The narrators always says jungle, so you to take it up with National Geographic. They are not the king of all beasts, for they cannot beat many of the animals in Africa. I am aware that jaguars and tigers do not live in Africa and did not claim they did!
Awesome !!!!!! 
They say it's a caiman repeatedly in the video and it even says it in the description, what more do you want?
This just makes me miss the Crocodile Hunter. 
Looks CGI... kind of fake. Plus the narrator is not a usual voice that you hear on NatGeo. 
From the video it is not clear that the caiman is dead, despite what the narrator says.
Wow!!!!!
ha ha ha ha ha ha!
If a lion attack Dracula , I don't think Dracula had time to react . The lion would already disembowel Dracula before Dracula could change into a bat .
Damn Nature ! You Scary !
so this is any less amazing?
it's a caiman not a crocodile!! it's much harder to kill a crocodile..even pythons kill caimans..
This is why the jaguars were so sacred in Mesoamerica. 
well not going to brazil now... They have cats that swim, and eat crocs? screw that
Big Buddy messed up that Caiman! Wham! Hope it tasted good bud. Just another day in the bush before the Capitalist get to it.
damn lol. even crocs can get caught slippin lol
They love to eat turtle species as well, crushing power indeed.
DAYUM
This is the normal color variant hunting in full daylight... imagine how deadly the melanistic variant (black panther) is at night.
strongest pounds per square inch in that cat family vs leopards. Its like me bighting onto a cow and then dragging it up a tree to my tree house. 250 vs ? a ton? they are not the biggest but wow! They are strong jawed!
I would certainly survive longer than this one who will eventually get attacked and drowned by a croc while swimming across the river. 
Lmao!!!
Because not many know what a caiman is, so to get more viewers they put "crocodile". 
The jaguar immobilized it's prey that looked bigger than the itself - and casually lifted it off the water and that was it. A little bit more as someone said earlier would have been nice - but it is, no doubt a classy job of filming. Congrats.. 
Have you ever seen your cute little kitty cat's jaw quiver when looking out the window at those little birds? That is exactly what that quivering did to the spine of that croc. 
Amazing hunt. That jaguar was on point.
the Smoke Jaguar
He came out the water like Rambo! "Meow mother fucker." BOOM!
Damn nature u scary
This jaguar was really hungry!
Nice video.
You will see more when they release a NatGeo special on this topic. This is just a tease.
the worst narrating voice i've ever heard
I always read about jaguars doing this kind of thing, but I have never seen footage until now! That's amazing!
The word your looking for is apex. Jaguars are apex predators
Great video but disappointed to see that National geographic can not tell the difference between the Caiman and Crocodile especially since the title says Crocodile and description says Caiman
That's some pretty rare footage; Jaguars are extremely shy and stealthy. I've eaten Caiman, but never like that; Always the tail West Indian and South American style. Great shot!
Who told Nat Geo to stop the video right there?? I wanted to see him swimming with it... 
...and that is why you wouldn't survive as a jaguar. 
That's some Army shit! 
a Caiman is NOT a Crocodile. 
a Caiman is NOT a Crocodile. 
Predator eat the other predator.. Very awesome video.. great job, boy..! Jaguar is not just a predator. They are the Super Predator in Amazon jungle 
Damn nature!
One, two, boom!
A Leopard on Steroids. Amazing to see a large cat built like a Staffordshire Bull Terrier.
speak english 
Best video in a while, good job
Like a boss. 
Very risky move by the Jaguar to be swimming in the water in my mind, it is lucky a crocodile hasn't attacked it while swimming yet. It would have zero chance to fight it off. 
One of my uncles is the same way when it comes to bbq ribs. One bite to the rib and it's all over but the cole slaw. :(
aray ko po!
Don't fuck with jaguars. 
Why would humans "get along with natures balances" (whatever that means) when we can take ourselves out of the food chain? Yet you say every other animal that is in the food chain is "very smart"
Jaguar is a pound for pound fighter.
DAM NATURE, YOU SCARY
Polar bear would.. Not that you see too many polar bears on the Nile, but they don't seem to have a problem with 750kg Walrus. Of course a big lion is 250kg at best, a big polar bear can be as big as 700kg, big difference. 
That Jaguar must be with seal team 6 
'Very smart', try very stupid. The 'balance with nature' is a lie. Try balancing with nature when a fucking asteroid hits your habitat. That's why humans are the way we are, because we can't be 'satisfied with what we have' if we want to survive.
Nature's balance? What does that even mean? 
You find value in watching it on youtube, other people find value in holding this 'beautiful creature's pelt in their hands. 
Amazing kill. hunting at it's finest.
impressive. 
Every animal is very smart of getting along with the natures balances except humans. 
That is one bad mutha
Like i said greed and money and fame can make anything happen. Example take a look at "Lion vs Cheetah- Male Lion Kills two Cheetahs"... 
Great camera work. I love Nature.
Damn nature, you scary.
Damn nature, you scary!!!
Watch this...Ôªø
They can grow to 14-15 feet. That's not "small" if you ask me. ;-) That one looked like about an 8 footer. 
wow...love mother nature 
I guess they dont have enough money!!
damn..... I didn't even know they eat those??
I believe he was using sarcasm. 
caiman are tiny, if it was a nile crocodile, not even a lion would have a chance
Outstanding footage!!!
Dayum! Nature you scary! 
That was bad ass.
is it a Caiman or a crocodile ( he said Caiman at about 1:43 )... their are some differences, mostly that caimans are typically smaller then even alligators. I know that caimans are sometimes grouped with either alligators or crocs but they are still smaller.
our housecat did the exact same thing to a robin in the back yard. it's just generations of evolution and instinct driving the jaguar to obtain his next meal, nothing more. 
it wasn't a gator
its nice to see nature but i get kinda sad when something dies lol. well at least the jaguar got his food
I always find it amazing how they can lift with their jaws. I saw a Leopard on PBS catch a baby wild boar (Wart Hog) And quickly run up a tree as the adult chased it.
I wish the "Jacksonville" Jaguars were highly skilled as this one.
That's how I approach white girls...hioh
You don't care about the gators until one eats your kids. Do you even care about different parts of the US or only your surburbanite neighborhood. That shit is food and a boots fuck it. Go eat an organic dick.
It depends on the species. This one obviously swam out of necessity to reach the caiman, but others, such as tigers, swim for pleasure.
Caiman was sedated, Greed and fame have taken over the world. 
Love this, thanks NG!!! REBT :)

This is incredible to see!Ôªø
I've watched this over and over and over again. Wow!! I never knew big cat's hunt and swim like that; and they eat croc's too?! Oh my god. What a great tube!
when you are poor and have mouths to feed people will do anything ;)
6.0X Sneak Attack!
No shit. Read the description.
Thats one badass jaguar eats crocodiles for breakfast
One-two-boom. Teeth-in. Wish I had that cat's precision.
damn where's the wholes video 
There's no crocodiles in south america that's a caiman
Now that's what I call a first class predator!
Sorry.....gave it a thumbs-down: where is the rest of the video? I want to see what happened NEXT!
what a beast! 
best NG video
Only buttfucking rednecks who fuck their sisters like you would hunt an animal like that. Go back to your trailer and point the gun at your head....pull the trigger. One less.....redneck. Done
Wow
Survival of the fittest...the Jaguar won! 
He took him down so fast the Jacksonville Jaguars gave him a deal.
I love that Jaguar attacks.Ôªø
And at the end, he just picks it up by the neck like it's nothing. Holy shit. 
I don't often eat reptile, but when I do, it's caiman takeout.
Animal videos are the best. Thank you mother nature. Jaguar Attacks Crocodile (EXCLUSIVE VIDEO)Ôªø
The normal method is with a high powered rifle. It allows a single kill shot, which can be placed in an area that won't spoil the hide.
NOPE!
DAMN NATURE YOU SCARY 
Jaguar dont give a shit !
That far distant crocodile getting into the water at 1:37...
Beautiful creature. I don't understand how people can kill these animals for profit.
Hold my beer.
Especially around the lake. So many places to hide on the golf course. :P

I was gonna say the same thing. 
Dat jag went all Mike Tyson on dat croc, ya heard?
Well I'm turned on...
Give, you should not be watching NatGeo if you can't stand the video of nature at its best!!..screw PETA!!!
All animals, but humans can see lines emanating from the eyes, that is one fact why cats can bite where they bite! Thing that amazing me about this video is the fact that this cat was aware of those filming him, not normal with this cats! 
FarCry3 Jaguar Style
man this is one of those special moments i actually remembered that skit
That's what I do to my girl. Except in reverse order. I pounce on that kitty kat and do my dirty deeds and leave it paralyzed for a few minutes.
That Caiman in the background at 1:37 says "fuck this, i'm out"
its a hard knock life
ASSASSICAT
I've been hiking in Estes park alone. Don't do that!.. or this will happen to you. except it will be a mountain lion. what was i thinking?! 
I say let that jaguar loose in the White House ........
the jacksonville jaguars should probably sign this cat to play QB.
the jacksonville jaguars should probably sign this cat to play QB.
I WANT ONE, AND A CAR!!!
Where's PETA when you need em? This is true animal cruelty.
Are you the WEAKEST LINK? We dare that JAGUAR to go to CAYMAN ISLAND where CAYMANS rules.
congrats you've joined an elite group of those who can everything into a political issue in online comments, good job we are all very proud
After the Kill; picked up the Caiman like it was nothing. Showing after picking it up; the Jaguar was heading back across the river to the Family.
That'a how my boss does me when I'm surfing the Internet at work. 
As shown in the video once he/she latches on to the back of the neck of any animal it's then game over by that point.
DAMN NATURE YOU SCARRRYYYY
"You ate my cub now i eat you!"
I assure you that is a false statement as I have seen it done...
I love cats. Big or small, love'em all.
Lion is considered the king of beasts, not the jungle. Lions live on the savanna, not in the jungle. You are not the first one to bungle the jungle bit.
Amazing Silent HuntingÔªø
i could do that
who knew? that will teach me to think..
Jaguar : "you are my dinner motherfucker!!"
HEY, WTF??? Can we get a trigger warning in the title, fucking OP? I had Planet Earth PTSD flashbacks after watching this! You're so fucking sued...
The Jag watched swamped people to know where to kill spot is on the gator.
I feel like I am the caiman and Obama is the Jag. Obamacare is sneaking up us all.
Damn, Just like a Boss!!!
This cat ain't no pussy!
AWESOME 
Damn nature, you beautiful and mesmerizing. 
Ya it would. 
Who said it would?? Just saying.
That's what you get for thinking. 
never would have believed it could happen.
jaguars and tigers love it. 
inb4 cheapshot
wow... okay. ha 
thought cats hated water..
That is awesome!!!
That Jaguar wouldn't be able to catch a adult crocodile or a alligator..Just saying. 
Wow, awesome.
MASTER hunter
The crocodile ate his dear, it's the only explanation.
My paw said anythag that taste like chicken was suppose to be ate. 
See in a while crocodile
What causes someone to thumbs down this video?
Meow that is phenomenal. 
I had no idea they did that.

This shows that a lion is not the king of the jungle; it is the jaguar. You will never get a lion to attack a crocodile or a alligator, for they are too busy running away.
my grandma is like that jaguar and im the crocodile.
if only the jaguars football team was this skilled!
I love these nature videos, from the hunts to the awesome escapes. So exciting.

Holy shit!

Jaguar get its meal
You SNOOZE, You LOSE!
here thru yahoo
Now Who's the boss?
Most impressive! Wonder how it would turn out if the Jag and the Cayman met in the water?
1:37 Croc in the back is like "Peace, I'm out"
See you in a while crocodile...
damn dam i want to know what happened 
I wish the video went on a little longer because it looked like the cat was going to swim back across the river with that big caman in it's mouth. Can you say POWER!
The jag is the baddest pound for pound cat in the wild. Twice the crushing jaw power of a lion and most efficient hunter of all four cat in felid family.
Damn nature. You scary.
3 or 4 Jaguar can probably take down a male Croc. Like the female Lions hunt in packs and occasionally take down a full grown Hippo, which is far heavier than a Croc.
I think in my lil kitten's mind, this is what he sees when he pounces on his stuffed animals. Nature is so awesome!Ôªø
No one with the "damn nature you scary" comment
thats so boss 
were u there in person
Jaguar Attacks CrocodileÔªø
and they are made of bronze too.
awsome and crazy
Gators do eat to survive, just like you and everything else that breathes on this planet. What's "good" about seeing them get eaten?
It's what's for lunch...Ôªø
Looks like someone isn't an apex predator after all.
DOWN KITTY
LMAO xDDD
get a life you cock sucker! 
It does not show definitively that the caiman is finished. I'd still give a 25% chance to it.
look at the balls on him @ 0:16
I would of never thought that a Crocodile was on a Jaguar 's Menu! This is incredible watching the Jaguar catch the Croc!Ôªø
You see that University of Tennessee? Your next Saturday!
lmaooo @ title Jaguar Attacks "Crocodile"
Good to see a gator get eaten for once!
Lol!
Jacksonville Jaguars signed him later that day
good job simba
Awesome video! I hope to visit the Brazilian pantanal soon. Jaguars are very feared in Brazil (as they should be, of course!), but unfortunately not respected...give the cat respect! ;)
Fb brought me here
the fuck is up with all the background noise????

Holy fuck
global warming is even causing animals to go insane
Cats and lizards :) Ôªø
Wow I didn't know that jaguars eat crocs two there amazing
This cycle of brutal savagery for survival is what some people call "Intelligent Design." Hah, what a joke.

Para turyst√≥w, kt√≥ra przyjecha≈Ça na wakacje do Brazylii z Berkeley w Kalifornii, liczy≈Ça na to ≈ºe podczas tej wyprawy zobaczƒÖ jaguary (*Panthera onca*), jedne z najpiƒôkniejszych zwierzƒÖt ≈õwiata.

Wow
If you believe that GOD entrusted YOU and just you with the truth and somehow he manifested to you but every body else is wrong, then You really need to lower your daily dose of Arrogance, it's getting to your brain. 
Jaguars are totally awesome. I never knew they could kill crocs. What a powerful animal. 
Nice!Ôªø
prezente de um video 
dope
No wonder Jaguars were worshiped as gods, for truly they are masters of all they survey.
Amazing !!
Unreal, amazing video
Feel bad for the gator, but that's just a part of the life
GOD exist,but your brain doesn't work ,so you don't exist , anyone who believe in science will conclude to god existence 
Evolution did
AMAZING!
Ahhh yes Allah did make some amazing animals! ... Or was it Jesus?, or Shiva?.... or Zeus...or Jah...or Amun...Or the Spaghetti monster... Or the other thousands of Gods conceived by mankind?.. For the love of God man, be more specific, who made this amazing beast? WHO?!?!?!?!
Esto yo no me lo sab√≠a.Ôªø
there you go, you keep nature & youtube in one place, you get countless atheists and believers frowning upon each other! XD
God entrusted man with taking care of his creation--read Genesis! It's our failure, not his.
Holy shit that was amazing 
Woah!!
Good damn just like that?

No, the results of evolution are amazing. For this reason, we have to protect endangered species, since God doesn't seem to be doing a great job at it.

Damn religious nut-jobs are everywhere
That's one brave Cat.
Way to devolve the issue, "scientist."
WE WANT MORE OF THE VIDEO 
Good!!
"God" also made incredibly stupid humans who actually worship a deity in the sky.
I was looking for chuck norris
true very good narrator ... scanning a buffet line .. ha ha
Hunger is the driving factor... I would say a very experienced Jaguar, with excellent hunting skills, coupled with one of the most powerful jaws in the animal kingdom (Nice video).

Gr8 to know crocs got predators too. Get some jaguars into African savanna.
Woooow that was amazing
Beautiful. You got to love felines. The cat family is the best family. 
This kind of content is so much better than the garbage (a.k.a. reality shows) they peddle now days.
A beautiful video, definately worth the 2 minutes :)
That's how Gordon Ramsey prepares Caymen too.

Damn nature, you scary!
Great rare footage! Thanks for posting.
suck my schlong
nathan tucker - dont get wrong this is a jaguar..,not a leopard.., NatGeo..,is a professional team...
sexy
Beautiful, cunning creature.
Yeah but did he skin it to eat it, or did he just gorge on the soft underbelly, was he desperate or just didnt want to miss the chance
SECONDED
amazing
actualy leopard not a leopord..,eheheee
if those are caiman then that is a jaguar. jaguars are the only big cat like that in the americas. if you google jaguars and google leopards you will see that the jaguars have big spots like in this video. both jaguars and caiman live in the americas. so dont worry about NAT GEO, they got it right. you should probably do a little research before you go saying stupid shit. 
Survival of the slickest haha
so some randumb utube douche blasts everyone for thinking it is a leapord
I will always Represent & Embrace National Geo., some of you youtube-goers just hate on 300 nat geo videos, then come back to love their new video.. Optimum cable provides H2, NatGeo, etc, discovery used to be my favorite back then, but i do not know what happen, the network seem to have lost that "Thing" that made Discovery Favorable in my opinion. but NatGeo Never lost their "Thing", that is why i love natgeo.. Do not sleep on H2 though. The Jag earned my respect, i never knew they chew crocs
it probably could have been a jaguar, because their jaws are much more wider than leopard.. jaguars have a bulky build in their front leg area & upper chest.. I believe it was a Jag. color wise resemble leopard but not physical built.
1:48 there u can see others croc's want to help his friend...,

this video reminded me of a similar one where a tiger attacks a man on an elephant. check it out /watch?v=T0kzdu_wTM0
Awesome content. Keep it up Nat Geo.
This is great. We rarely get to see jaguars in action. They are so underrated in comparison to the other big cats.
Evolution son
I did not know Jags eat crocodiles 
I'd give you a round of applause NatGeo, if I didn't think this was your once a month clip that isn't total crap. Well, maybe a golf clap

gah! come on National Geographic, I know that you know better than that. Crocodiles do not live in the American continents ... and the video itself says "Caiman" clearly and you have it right in the "about" section ... at least "alligator" would have been better. lol Still liked the video though, very cool.
Let's be honest caymans are the fuqbois of the crocodile family
what bad cat! 
More of this and less of pseudo reality programming please!
Whoa O_O Like a bawss!
yeah makes it 10 times better for nabs who have no idea whats happening
commentator makes this sound like were watching sports: '' one, two, boom!"
Why Jaguars are cooler than Lions

My wife got a jaguar in her garage, a mink on her back, a tiger in bed;..............and a jackass to pay for it all!
jaguars have the most powerfull bite force of all big cats, doesn't matter what animal, if they bite your head it will crush your skull with only one bite, they can easily break turtle shells, it only takes them one bite
this is going to be a viral video
Wow! That's incredible
i don't trust you people making such a thing
Wow
Well done! just love how jaguar handle it!
os carn√≠voros s√£o muito lindos e quando atacam sua performance e fant√°stica....
I never knew jaguar would attack any caiman or were great swimmers.
first blood
What the Heck did i just see??????
the world you live within have no lie but you sucker
wow
